# Unit 1 - The Road to the Great War

## The World in 1900

The World in 1900 was a hugely different one to the one we live in today. During the 20th century technology progressed at a rapid pace and a series on inventions changed the way people lived. Television, the internet and air travel were all a reality by the end of the century. At the beginning of the century people were much more cut off, foreign travel was for the wealthy, life expectancy was low and the vast majority of people in Europe lived in terrible conditions with little access to education, healthcare and for many a regular supply of food.

Today most countries govern themselves, with a parliament elected by the people. However, in the 20th century many Non-European countires were colonies. Britain, France and Germany controlled huge amounts of territory around the world, these were known as empires. This game them access to raw materials, a market for goods produced in the home country and people to fight in the armed forces.

The British Empire was by far the most powerful empire in the world in 1900. At its height, Britain controlled 1/4 of global territory and population. It was protected by the Royal Navy which was the strongest navy in the world.

Today we would call the United States and China superpowers. In the early 20th century Britain was the only superpower. However, Britain was not the only powerful European country. France and Germany had empires of their own, Germany had also overtaken Britain in industry and manufacturing and was beginning to build its own navy to challenge Britain's.

The USA was also becoming a strong country at this stage. It had a large population, huge amounts of land and was welcoming immigrants from all over the world. The US government followed a policy of isolation, meaning they would stay out of any global conflicts and look after their own interests. However, they would later be unable to stay out of WWI as it began to have an impact on their trade with Europe.

***Tensions in the early 20th century:***

1. Imperial Rivalries
    - Britain, France, and Germany all had empires and competed for territory, raw materials, and markets.
    - The competition between European powers for global dominance could easily lead to tensions and clashes, especially in areas where their empires overlapped or where new colonies were being claimed.  
2. Military Competition
    - Britain has the strongest navy, but Germany was building up its own navy to challenge British dominance.
    - This arms race created suspicion and fear between countries, especially between Britain and Germany.
3. Industrial and Economic Rivalry
    - Germany had overtaken Britain in industry and manufacturing, making it a serious competitor.
    - Economic power was closely linked to military and imperial power, so this rivalry would have increased jealousy and competition.

## Causes of WWI
### Alliances
The Great War has a number of long-term and short-term causes. Millions and millions of men, split into two sides (or alliances) spent over 4 years killing each other. To help them in this task they used the deadliest weapons the world had ever seen. Around 9 million people were killed by the end of the war, that is around 5000 deaths / day for the duration of the war. Such was the duration and scale of the conflict that it became known as 'the war to end all wars' (yeah ryt buddy spot on)

One of the long-term causes of the war was the Alliance System, a complicated network of relationships within Europe. There were two alliances in Europe.

***The Triple Entente:*** Great Britain; France; Russia
***The Triple Alliance:*** Germany; Austria-Hungary; Italy

|Great Power|Fears|Ambitions|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Great Britain|Germany's growing industry and army raised competition from Great Britain|Its ambition was to maintain power as the strongest on Earth and keep Germany from catching up|
|Germany|Its fear was getting surrounded by enemies, which would greatly impact their situation|They wanted to have more European land and an overseas empire|
|France|Germany's growing industry and army, as addressed by Great Britain|They wanted to get revenge on Germany|
|Austria-Hungary|They feared all encouragement of nationalism would break up his empire|They wanted to keep the empire together|
|Italy|Missing out on Great Power Politics and being overlooked as an important European country|To become a Great Power and have an overseas empire|
|Russia|Very little industry and resources|To get ice free ports and modern technology|

# Unit 2 - The Great War Begins

## The Schlieffen Plan (De Shleefen plaun)

**Stalemate**: A position of standstill or deadlock in battle where neither side can move to victory.

All the Great Powers of Europe has a plan in case war broke out on the continent. Britain's plan was to send the British Expeditionary Force (BEF, a small but well-trained army) across the Channel to defend France and Belgium; France's Plan Seventeen was to obliterate the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine which Germany had taken from them decades earlier; Austria and Russia's plan were almost identical - destroy each other at any cost.

However, Germany's plan was quite unique. Because France and Russia were both members of the triple Entente (Germany's enemies), Germany could be attacked by France from the west, and Russia from the east at the very same time. This is known as a war on two fronts. To avoid this, Germany's Chief of Military Staff called Alfed von Schlieffen came up with a plan that depended on speed to quickly knock France out of the war before turning to Russia on its other border. Russia was vast and therefore slower to mobilise its troops. This became known as the **Schlieffen Plan**.

### 1

German forces were to attack France through Belgium. (Originally it had been planned to attack the Benelux countries of Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland, but in 1906 Schlieffen retired and his successor, Helmuth von Molkte decided the attack should be directed though Belgium.)

### 2

90% of the German Army was to be used to quickly knock France out of the war with overwhelming force and take Paris in under six weeks. It was believed that the Belgians would not stand up to the might of the German war machine.

### 3 

German military leaders believe that Britain would remain neutral if they attacked France. Britain had a Treaty with Belgium signed in 1839, but the Germans felt it was of no importance and referred to it as a scrap of paper.

### 4 

While the majority of the German Army would take France, the remaining 10% would defend the eastern border against a Russian assault. However, it was considered unlikely that a country the size of Russia could mobilise its army within six weeks.

They need a ***QUICK*** war.

# Unit 2 - The Great War Begins

## Reasons for the failure of the Schlieffen Plan

- The Germans did not expect resistance from Belgium
- Russia mobilised its troops in much shorter than 6 weeks (10 days)
- The Germans underestimated the BEF
- The British Expeditionary Force helped secure the River Marne and pushed the German border back 35 miles
- Britain did in fact **not** stay neutral (whoopsies)
- Belgians flooded the German land to prevent Germans from taking French Channel ports.

## What conditions did soldiers face in WWI?

**Escalation**: Trench Warfare was one of the most brutal aspects of WWI, and is what most people associate with the war. Following the failure of the Schlieffen Plan both sides dug trenches in an attempt to protect themselves. The Western Front quickle developed. In the Eat, the same scenario developed. What many had expected to be a war of rapid movement quickly turned into one of stalemate. **Summary**: 1. Both Fronts dug trenches 2. The War became a stalemate.

**Harsh Conditions**: Life on the frontlines was difficult for soldiers. Conditons were apalling, especially in the winter. Trenches quickly became waterlogged, full of rats, lice and maggots. Most soldiers experienced the loss of comrades and friends on a daily basis. The fear of death was an ever present scenario to match the near constant artillery fire from the enemy trenches. **Summary**: 1. Most died 2. Fear of death was always present.

**Melee**: Attacks on the frontline trenches were a regular occurence and soldiers had to be prepared to fight in close quarters using knives and clubs during their time on the front. They also had to be prepared to attack the enemy trenches and 'go over the top'. **Summary**: 1. Soldiers were prepared to fight melee 2. Attacks on frontline trenches were a common occurence.

**Harsh Conditions v2**: Along with the fighting conditons many soldiers complained about the food and general unhygienic nature of the setting. Fresh food was non-existent and rations came in tins, with cheese, spam and 'bully beef' being their main nutrition **Summary**: 1. Food came in tins 2. Food conditions were horrible.

## The Role of Women in WWI

Before the war, the most common employment for a woman was as a domestic servant. However, women were also employed in what were seen to be suitable occupations e.g. teaching, nursing, office work. When war broke out in August 1914, thousands of women were sacked from jobs in dressmaking, millinery and jewellery making. They needed work and they wanted to help the war effort.

As soon as the war broke out, both the suffragists and the suffragettes suspended their campaigns for votes for women. They believed that the war was more important than their cause. During the war they played an active part persuading British men to join the army, by handing out white feathers to those who refused to sign up (as a form of mockery).

### How did women contribute to the British war effort

Most pupils will have heard of women serving as battlefield nurses, but they contributed in so many more ways than this. Because of naval battles and blockades during the war, food supplies from abroad became scarce and food production on the home front had to be massively increased. 113,000 women joined the Women's Land Army which was set up in 1917 to provide a workforce to run the farms.

From an early stage in the war, Britain began to suffer a shortage of labour. In offices, women were soon employed in place of the male clerks who joined up. 

In manufacturing, however, employers were very reluctant to take on women to fill men's jobs. They thought women would not learn the necessary skills, and also feared trouble from the unions. In fact, the unions did resist the employment of female workers, fearing that women would be paid less and this would be a threat to men's wages.

By 1916 the shortage of workers (due to conscription) persuaded employers to take on female workers and these soon showed that even with very little training they were as skilled as men. Munitions work was tiring and dangerous. As the war went on, shifts got longer and longer.

A kind of revolution was taking place. Women gained access to a whole range of jobs that had previously been the preserve of men - bus drivers, postal workers, farm labourers, coal deliverers, grave diggers and steel workers. The armed forces also employed them. Wages from women rose as well.

These oppotunities and the money meant that women had much more freedom than every before. It was now more possible for a girl to be seen out dining alone in a restaurant without a male friend. Some women began to smoke in public. The new freedom affected looks and fashion too, shorter skirts and hair, more suitable for a changing life-style.

Therefore, women became more emancipated in practice and this made the demand for the vote in national elections even more likely to be recognised.

> "When the war ended, women were expected to give way to men returning from the forces and return to "pre-war" women's work. With this, assumption that a woman's place is in the home returned. Many didn't like this. The percentage of women at work returned to pre-war levels, but more women than before worked in offices. Meanwhile, shorter skirts and hair became fashionable and women went out with men without a chaperone, Some women even smoked and work make-up in public for the first time. In 1919, being female or married was no longer allowed to disqualify someone from holding a job in the professions or civil service, while wages for women went up."

# Unit 3 - The Battle of the Somme

## Why did the battle of the Somme happen?

In 1915, the Muslim Ottoman Empire joined WWI on Germany's side. The empire had existed for centuries but was on its last legs. It controlled most of the middle East and was centred in modern-day turkey. The Ottomans entering the war had a number of consequences:
1. Turkey had been friendly with Germany for some time. They were now both bitter rivals of Russia,
2. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was now trapped in the Black Sea
3. The Western Allies could no longer ship supplies to Russia
4. Ottoman troops could seize the Suez Canal in Egypt and shut Britain off from her Empire.

With a new enemy, Britain saw the chance to open a new front in the war and attack Germany from a different angle. This was because:
- Britain believed the Ottoman Empire was Germany's weakest link (partly racist)
- Defeat of the Turks might also knock Bulgaria and Austria out of the war, Germany's allies
- Defeat of the Turks would allow better communication with the Russians
- Defeat of the Turks would protect the Suez Canal and British oil-fields in Persia

As head of the Royal Navy, a young Winston Churchill hatched a plan that would allow Britain to break the war stalemate without defeating Germany on the Western Front. He proposed:
- Landing British and French Troops on Gallipoli Peninsula to knock out Turkish artillery
- Sailing warships through the Dardanelles to Constantinople, centre of the Ottoman Empire
- Turks were weak, theyd instantly surrender
- Using troops from Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India and other colonies.

Colonial troops made up half of the British army and were crucial in major supplies.

In mid-1915 a new British army began pouring into France. All these men had left their ordinary jobs and had volunteered to become soldiers for as long as the war lasted. General Haig Joffre agreed to use this volunteer army as part of an enormous combined British and French attack against the German lines. The attack was to be made in an area around the river Somme in Northern France, and would start in June or early July 1916. The British and French began to equip and train over 100,000 men.

The Germans, however, knew what was happening. Their men in scout planes and observer balloons saw newly-built roads and railway lines, and watched thousands of soldiers arriving with guns, ammunition and supplies. They were not taken by surprise when a massive bombardment began on 24 June. Quickly German troops moved back from their frontline to strongly built dugouts which were more than 12 m deep. On 1 July bombardment ended. General Haig believed that it had knocked out most of the German frontline. He did not know that the Allies had been shelling empty trenches. Haig ordered his troops to advance towards the German lines.

By dusk on 1 July 57,540 allied and 8,000 german soldiers were dead or wounded. General Haig pressed on. He saw no reason to change his tactics. Between July and November 1916 he ordered attack after attack, always with the same dreadful results. In September, against advice from military experts, he used a new weapon, the tank. Only 50 were ready for war. Twenty nine of these broke down before reaching the battle field, and the rest soon got stuck in the mud. By November both sides were exhausted. 620,000 Allied and 450,000 German soldiers had been killed or wounded in the Battle of the Somme. Of the Allied dead or wounded, 460,000 British soldiers were killed or hurt between July and Novermber 1916. At most the Allies had avanced by 15 km along part of the Western front.

### Was Field Marshal Haig the butcher of the somme?

By December 1915 there was still stalemate on the Western Front. The British began to question how well their army was being led, and on 10th December 1915 a new commander of the British Fores was appointed. 

He was 54 years old, and was born in Edinburgh. Haig already had a long and succesful career by the time he took his new post in 1915. He had been a celebrated cavalry commander in the Boer WAr fifteen years earlier. He also served in Indiea and became the youngest man ever to become Major-General. When Haig returned to England, he helped organise reforms to enable the British Army to take part in a European Conflict. To all around him, Haig was considered top-notch.

Haig was faced with a difficult task. Trench warfare was a new type of fighting anf one which commanders were not used to dealing with. Below are some statements that Haig made about how this new type of war should be fought:
1907: Succes in battle depends mainly on morale and determination
1915: The way to capture a machine gun is by grit and determination
1916: The machine gun is a much overrated weapon
1916: We must wear the enemy down as much as possible

Haig's good points:
- Has alright plans

Haig's bad points:
- Never visited frontlines
- Believes determination is key
- Never updated plans
- Never dealt with machine guns
- No experience in modern warfare
- Didn't account for actual soldiers
- Didn't have a proper plan with wire
- Didn't have a beneficial plan
