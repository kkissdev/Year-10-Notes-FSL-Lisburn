## The Role of Women in WWI

Before the war, the most common employment for a woman was as a domestic servant. However, women were also employed in what were seen to be suitable occupations e.g. teaching, nursing, office work. When war broke out in August 1914, thousands of women were sacked from jobs in dressmaking, millinery and jewellery making. They needed work and they wanted to help the war effort.

As soon as the war broke out, both the suffragists and the suffragettes suspended their campaigns for votes for women. They believed that the war was more important than their cause. During the war they played an active part persuading British men to join the army, by handing out white feathers to those who refused to sign up (as a form of mockery).

### How did women contribute to the British war effort

Most pupils will have heard of women serving as battlefield nurses, but they contributed in so many more ways than this. Because of naval battles and blockades during the war, food supplies from abroad became scarce and food production on the home front had to be massively increased. 113,000 women joined the Women's Land Army which was set up in 1917 to provide a workforce to run the farms.

From an early stage in the war, Britain began to suffer a shortage of labour. In offices, women were soon employed in place of the male clerks who joined up. 

In manufacturing, however, employers were very reluctant to take on women to fill men's jobs. They thought women would not learn the necessary skills, and also feared trouble from the unions. In fact, the unions did resist the employment of female workers, fearing that women would be paid less and this would be a threat to men's wages.

By 1916 the shortage of workers (due to conscription) persuaded employers to take on female workers and these soon showed that even with very little training they were as skilled as men. Munitions work was tiring and dangerous. As the war went on, shifts got longer and longer.

A kind of revolution was taking place. Women gained access to a whole range of jobs that had previously been the preserve of men - bus drivers, postal workers, farm labourers, coal deliverers, grave diggers and steel workers. The armed forces also employed them. Wages from women rose as well.

These oppotunities and the money meant that women had much more freedom than every before. It was now more possible for a girl to be seen out dining alone in a restaurant without a male friend. Some women began to smoke in public. The new freedom affected looks and fashion too, shorter skirts and hair, more suitable for a changing life-style.

Therefore, women became more emancipated in practice and this made the demand for the vote in national elections even more likely to be recognised.

> "When the war ended, women were expected to give way to men returning from the forces and return to "pre-war" women's work. With this, assumption that a woman's place is in the home returned. Many didn't like this. The percentage of women at work returned to pre-war levels, but more women than before worked in offices. Meanwhile, shorter skirts and hair became fashionable and women went out with men without a chaperone, Some women even smoked and work make-up in public for the first time. In 1919, being female or married was no longer allowed to disqualify someone from holding a job in the professions or civil service, while wages for women went up."
