# Unit 3 - The Battle of the Somme

## Why did the battle of the Somme happen?

In 1915, the Muslim Ottoman Empire joined WWI on Germany's side. The empire had existed for centuries but was on its last legs. It controlled most of the middle East and was centred in modern-day turkey. The Ottomans entering the war had a number of consequences:
1. Turkey had been friendly with Germany for some time. They were now both bitter rivals of Russia,
2. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was now trapped in the Black Sea
3. The Western Allies could no longer ship supplies to Russia
4. Ottoman troops could seize the Suez Canal in Egypt and shut Britain off from her Empire.

With a new enemy, Britain saw the chance to open a new front in the war and attack Germany from a different angle. This was because:
- Britain believed the Ottoman Empire was Germany's weakest link (partly racist)
- Defeat of the Turks might also knock Bulgaria and Austria out of the war, Germany's allies
- Defeat of the Turks would allow better communication with the Russians
- Defeat of the Turks would protect the Suez Canal and British oil-fields in Persia

As head of the Royal Navy, a young Winston Churchill hatched a plan that would allow Britain to break the war stalemate without defeating Germany on the Western Front. He proposed:
- Landing British and French Troops on Gallipoli Peninsula to knock out Turkish artillery
- Sailing warships through the Dardanelles to Constantinople, centre of the Ottoman Empire
- Turks were weak, theyd instantly surrender
- Using troops from Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India and other colonies.

Colonial troops made up half of the British army and were crucial in major supplies.

In mid-1915 a new British army began pouring into France. All these men had left their ordinary jobs and had volunteered to become soldiers for as long as the war lasted. General Haig Joffre agreed to use this volunteer army as part of an enormous combined British and French attack against the German lines. The attack was to be made in an area around the river Somme in Northern France, and would start in June or early July 1916. The British and French began to equip and train over 100,000 men.

The Germans, however, knew what was happening. Their men in scout planes and observer balloons saw newly-built roads and railway lines, and watched thousands of soldiers arriving with guns, ammunition and supplies. They were not taken by surprise when a massive bombardment began on 24 June. Quickly German troops moved back from their frontline to strongly built dugouts which were more than 12 m deep. On 1 July bombardment ended. General Haig believed that it had knocked out most of the German frontline. He did not know that the Allies had been shelling empty trenches. Haig ordered his troops to advance towards the German lines.

By dusk on 1 July 57,540 allied and 8,000 german soldiers were dead or wounded. General Haig pressed on. He saw no reason to change his tactics. Between July and November 1916 he ordered attack after attack, always with the same dreadful results. In September, against advice from military experts, he used a new weapon, the tank. Only 50 were ready for war. Twenty nine of these broke down before reaching the battle field, and the rest soon got stuck in the mud. By November both sides were exhausted. 620,000 Allied and 450,000 German soldiers had been killed or wounded in the Battle of the Somme. Of the Allied dead or wounded, 460,000 British soldiers were killed or hurt between July and Novermber 1916. At most the Allies had avanced by 15 km along part of the Western front.
