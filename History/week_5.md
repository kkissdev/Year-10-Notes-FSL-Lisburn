# Unit 2 - The Great War Begins

## Reasons for the failure of the Schlieffen Plan

- The Germans did not expect resistance from Belgium
- Russia mobilised its troops in much shorter than 6 weeks (10 days)
- The Germans underestimated the BEF
- The British Expeditionary Force helped secure the River Marne and pushed the German border back 35 miles
- Britain did in fact **not** stay neutral (whoopsies)
- Belgians flooded the German land to prevent Germans from taking French Channel ports.

## What conditions did soldiers face in WWI?

**Escalation**: Trench Warfare was one of the most brutal aspects of WWI, and is what most people associate with the war. Following the failure of the Schlieffen Plan both sides dug trenches in an attempt to protect themselves. The Western Front quickle developed. In the Eat, the same scenario developed. What many had expected to be a war of rapid movement quickly turned into one of stalemate. **Summary**: 1. Both Fronts dug trenches 2. The War became a stalemate.

**Harsh Conditions**: Life on the frontlines was difficult for soldiers. Conditons were apalling, especially in the winter. Trenches quickly became waterlogged, full of rats, lice and maggots. Most soldiers experienced the loss of comrades and friends on a daily basis. The fear of death was an ever present scenario to match the near constant artillery fire from the enemy trenches. **Summary**: 1. Most died 2. Fear of death was always present.

**Melee**: Attacks on the frontline trenches were a regular occurence and soldiers had to be prepared to fight in close quarters using knives and clubs during their time on the front. They also had to be prepared to attack the enemy trenches and 'go over the top'. **Summary**: 1. Soldiers were prepared to fight melee 2. Attacks on frontline trenches were a common occurence.

**Harsh Conditions v2**: Along with the fighting conditons many soldiers complained about the food and general unhygienic nature of the setting. Fresh food was non-existent and rations came in tins, with cheese, spam and 'bully beef' being their main nutrition **Summary**: 1. Food came in tins 2. Food conditions were horrible.
