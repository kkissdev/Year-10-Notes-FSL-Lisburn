# Unit 2 - The Great War Begins

## Reasons for the failure of the Schlieffen Plan

- The Germans did not expect resistance from Belgium
- Russia mobilised its troops in much shorter than 6 weeks (10 days)
- The Germans underestimated the BEF
- The British Expeditionary Force helped secure the River Marne and pushed the German border back 35 miles
- Britain did in fact **not** stay neutral (whoopsies)
- Belgians flooded the German land to prevent Germans from taking French Channel ports.
