# Unit 2 - The Great War Begins

## The Schlieffen Plan (De Shleefen plaun)

**Stalemate**: A position of standstill or deadlock in battle where neither side can move to victory.

All the Great Powers of Europe has a plan in case war broke out on the continent. Britain's plan was to send the British Expeditionary Force (BEF, a small but well-trained army) across the Channel to defend France and Belgium; France's Plan Seventeen was to obliterate the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine which Germany had taken from them decades earlier; Austria and Russia's plan were almost identical - destroy each other at any cost.

However, Germany's plan was quite unique. Because France and Russia were both members of the triple Entente (Germany's enemies), Germany could be attacked by France from the west, and Russia from the east at the very same time. This is known as a war on two fronts. To avoid this, Germany's Chief of Military Staff called Alfed von Schlieffen came up with a plan that depended on speed to quickly knock France out of the war before turning to Russia on its other border. Russia was vast and therefore slower to mobilise its troops. This became known as the **Schlieffen Plan**.

### 1

German forces were to attack France through Belgium. (Originally it had been planned to attack the Benelux countries of Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland, but in 1906 Schlieffen retired and his successor, Helmuth von Molkte decided the attack should be directed though Belgium.)

### 2

90% of the German Army was to be used to quickly knock France out of the war with overwhelming force and take Paris in under six weeks. It was believed that the Belgians would not stand up to the might of the German war machine.

### 3 

German military leaders believe that Britain would remain neutral if they attacked France. Britain had a Treaty with Belgium signed in 1839, but the Germans felt it was of no importance and referred to it as a scrap of paper.

### 4 

While the majority of the German Army would take France, the remaining 10% would defend the eastern border against a Russian assault. However, it was considered unlikely that a country the size of Russia could mobilise its army within six weeks.

They need a ***QUICK*** war.
