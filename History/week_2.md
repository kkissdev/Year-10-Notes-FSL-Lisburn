# Unit 1 - The Road to the Great War

## The World in 1900

The World in 1900 was a hugely different one to the one we live in today. During the 20th century technology progressed at a rapid pace and a series on inventions changed the way people lived. Television, the internet and air travel were all a reality by the end of the century. At the beginning of the century people were much more cut off, foreign travel was for the wealthy, life expectancy was low and the vast majority of people in Europe lived in terrible conditions with little access to education, healthcare and for many a regular supply of food.

Today most countries govern themselves, with a parliament elected by the people. However, in the 20th century many Non-European countires were colonies. Britain, France and Germany controlled huge amounts of territory around the world, these were known as empires. This game them access to raw materials, a market for goods produced in the home country and people to fight in the armed forces.

The British Empire was by far the most powerful empire in the world in 1900. At its height, Britain controlled 1/4 of global territory and population. It was protected by the Royal Navy which was the strongest navy in the world.

Today we would call the United States and China superpowers. In the early 20th century Britain was the only superpower. However, Britain was not the only powerful European country. France and Germany had empires of their own, Germany had also overtaken Britain in industry and manufacturing and was beginning to build its own navy to challenge Britain's.

The USA was also becoming a strong country at this stage. It had a large population, huge amounts of land and was welcoming immigrants from all over the world. The US government followed a policy of isolation, meaning they would stay out of any global conflicts and look after their own interests. However, they would later be unable to stay out of WWI as it began to have an impact on their trade with Europe.

1. Imperial Rivalries
  - Britain, France, and Germany all had empires and competed for territory, raw materials, and markets.
  - The competition between European powers for global dominance could easily lead to tensions and clashes, especially in areas where their empires overlapped or where new colonies were being claimed.
2. Military Competition
  - Britain had the strongest navy, but Germany was building up its own navy to challenge British dominance.
  - This arms race created suspicion and fear between countries, especially between Britain and Germany.
3. Industrial and Economic Rivalry
  - Germany had overtaken Britain in industry and manufacturing, making it a serious competitor.
  - Economic power was closely linked to military and imperial power, so this rivalry would have increased jealousy and competition.
