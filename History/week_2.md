## The World in 1900

The World in 1900 was a hugely different one to the one we live in today. During the 20th century technology progressed at a rapid pace and a series on inventions changed the way people lived. Television, the internet and air travel were all a reality by the end of the century. At the beginning of the century people were much more cut off, foreign travel was for the wealthy, life expectancy was low and the vast majority of people in Europe lived in terrible conditions with little access to education, healthcare and for many a regular supply of food.

Today most countries govern themselves, with a parliament elected by the people. However, in the 20th century many Non-European countires were colonies. Britain, France and Germany controlled huge amounts of territory around the world, these were known as empires. This game them access to raw materials, a market for goods produced in the home country and people to fight in the armed forces.

The British Empire was by far the most powerful empire in the world in 1900. At its height, Britain controlled 1/4 of global territory and population. It was protected by the Royal Navy which was the strongest navy in the world.
