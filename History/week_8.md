### Was Field Marshal Haig the butcher of the somme?

By December 1915 there was still stalemate on the Western Front. The British began to question how well their army was being led, and on 10th December 1915 a new commander of the British Fores was appointed. 

He was 54 years old, and was born in Edinburgh. Haig already had a long and succesful career by the time he took his new post in 1915. He had been a celebrated cavalry commander in the Boer WAr fifteen years earlier. He also served in Indiea and became the youngest man ever to become Major-General. When Haig returned to England, he helped organise reforms to enable the British Army to take part in a European Conflict. To all around him, Haig was considered top-notch.

Haig was faced with a difficult task. Trench warfare was a new type of fighting anf one which commanders were not used to dealing with. Below are some statements that Haig made about how this new type of war should be fought:
1907: Succes in battle depends mainly on morale and determination
1915: The way to capture a machine gun is by grit and determination
1916: The machine gun is a much overrated weapon
1916: We must wear the enemy down as much as possible

Haig's good points:
- Has alright plans

Haig's bad points:
- Never visited frontlines
- Believes determination is key
- Never updated plans
- Never dealt with machine guns
- No experience in modern warfare
- Didn't account for actual soldiers
- Didn't have a proper plan with wire
- Didn't have a beneficial plan
