## The Eatwell Guide

 Consumers are exposed to a wide range of information about healthy eating, and over time this can become confusing. The 'Eatwell Guide' was produced by the Food Standards Agency as a tool to make healthy eating easier to understand.

 The 'Eatwell Guide' helps consumers by making it easy to see the types and proportions of different foods needed to achieve a healthy and well-balanced diet. Foods are divided onto the following five groups, which are represented by the plate:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sources|Dried mangos, frozen peas, tinned pineapple, orange juice, tomatoes, cucumber|Rice, spaghetti, potatoes, pasta, bread, porridge|Cheese, milk, yoghurt, soya dairy products|Chicken, fish, nuts, beans, pulses, lentils|Olive oil, rapeseed oil, vegetable oil, sunflower oil|
|Main nutrients|Carbs, vC, vA - beta carotene, water|Carbs, vBs, Calcium|Calcium, Protein, Fat, vD, Water|Protein, Fat, vD, Iron|Fat| 
|How much to eat|5 portions a day|1/3 of your diet|3 portions a day|2 portions of fish, one oily; less red + processed meat; consume more beans and pulses|Small amounts|
|How to eat|A variety; fresh, frozen, tinned, dried, juiced|Wholegrain or highfibre; less fat, salt and sugar|Choose lower fat ans sugar|Low fat, lean meat, oily fish|Unsaturated oils|

The Food Standards Agency has identified '8 tips for eating well'. These are:
**1. Base your meals on starchy foods**
**2. Eat lots of fruit and vegetables**
**3. Eat more fish - including a portion of oily fish each week**
**4. Cut down on saturated fat and sugar**
**5. Eat less salt - no more than 6g a day**
**6. Get active and be a healthy weight**
**7. Don't get thirsty**
**8. Don't skip breakfast**

### Fruit and veggies

Potatoes are not counted as a portion of fruit and veg. One portion = **80g**

Examples of a **single** portion:
- 1 apple, banana, orange, pear or other similar size fruit
- 2 plums or similar size fruits
- 1/2 a grapefruit or avocado
- 1 slice of large fruit, such as melon or pineapple
- 3 heaped TBSPs of veg
- 3 heaped TBSPs of fruit salad or stewed fruit (??)
- 1 heaped TBSPs of dried fruit
- a dessert bowl of salad
- a glass (150ml) of fruit juice (max. 1 portion. Consuming more than one portion of this does not count to another. This is because blending a fruit destorys the cellulose and pretty much is the same as adding sugar)
- 1 cupful of grapes, cherries or berries

You can choose from fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.

|Nutrient|Food source|
|:-|:-|
|vC|oranges, blackcurrants, strawberries, green peppers|
|Ca & Fe|dark green leafy veg e.g. spinach, cabbage and broccoli|
|Dietary Fibre|plums, dried apricots, peas and berries|

3 way to make fruit and veg more appealing to children and teens:
- Fruit only break times
- Drinks, e.g. smoothies, juice
- In food e.g. stew, soup, pizza, pasta

### Fish

Aim to have at least 2 portions of fish a week including a portion of oily fish. You can choose from fresh, frozen or canned.  
They are rich in &#969;-3 fatty acids, which helps prevent heart disease

8 examples of oily fish:
- Salmon
- Mackerel
- Trout
- Herring
- Fresh tuna
- Sardines
- Pilchards
- Eel

Smoked fish is high in salt, and avoid eating shark, swordfish or marlin because they are high in mercury, which can be dangerous, especially for pregnant women.
