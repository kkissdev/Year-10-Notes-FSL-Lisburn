## Sports Nutrition

The performance on sport the quality of their diet and how much they consume can have a dramatic effect. The amount of energy needed depends on the intensity, duration, frequency, type of exercise, age, gender, level of fitness and body fat stores of the individual. Some tips are:

- Eat a varied and balanced diet
- Eat plenty of carbohydrate rich foods
- Eat at least 5 portions of fruit and veg per day
- Start refuelling with carbohydrate and fluid as soon as possible
- Ensure plenty of liquid is consumed before, during and after exercise

The following nutrients are required during physical activity:

- Carbohydrates
- Protein
- Fat
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Fluid

### Carbohydrate

A diet rich in carbohydrate is important for the best performance. Complex carbohydrates are best because they are nutrient dense, filling and low in fat. Excess carbohydrate is stored as glycogen.

Maintained glycogen stores are essential for endurance and stamina. Once these stores are used up, muscles cannot work efficiently, and performance is affected. Athletes may become tired, nauseous or dizzy due to dropping sugar levels. It is important to replenish glycogen stores after exercising with low fat, high-carbohydrate snacks.

While most sportspeople maintain a high carbohydrate diet, those involved in endurance event (long distance running) may increase carbohydrate intake by more than 70 per cent in the three days preceding an event. This is known as 'carbohydrate loading' and, combined with a specialist training programme, it can increase glycogen stores and maximise performance.

### Protein

Most sportspeople can meet their protein requirements by following a balanced diet. Main meals should provide some protein, for example, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, beans, pulses, Quorn and nuts. Only athletes involved in heavy training may need to increase their protein intake in order to gain muscle. This would apply, for example, to weightlifters or those taking part in endurance events, such as marathon runners.

### Fat

A high fat diet makes it difficult to meet carbohydrate requirements and could affect weight management and energy balance. In particular, saturated fat intake should be monitored.

### Vitamins and Minerals

|Nutrient|Function|Sources|
|:-|:-|:-|
|vBs|They assist with release of energy and are particularly relevant for people who do sport|Meat; Dairy; Eggs; Pulses and green leafy veg; Fortified cereals|
|Fe|Sports people need good iron stores to ensure oxygen can be transported around the body and to boost energy stores|Lean red meat; Pulses; Green leafy veg|
|Calcium|Maintenance of bones and teeth. To achieve and maintain peak bone mass. Contributes to a stronger skeleton, makes bones less susceptible to damage and helps to repair body tissue|Milk, yoghurt and cheese; Green leafy veg|

### Fluid Intake

- Fluid intake should always be maintained during strenuous exercise and should be consumed before, during and after the acitivity.
- Water is necessary for proper functioning of the body.
    - Particularly important during summer months.
- Heat is produced as a by-product of work.
    - Must be removed from the body to keep the body at its preferred temperature.
- Sweat is produced to help cool the body.
    - Fluid lost via sweat must be continually replaced to enable this cooling process to continue.

Being well hydrated is essential in order to benefit from training. If sports people approach training and games in a semi-dehydrated condition this will impact on their performance.

Sports drinks have become more popular and can be useful for athletes to help with hydration. The more commonly purchased sports drinks are:

**Isotonic sports drinks**

Isotonic drinks are the **same** concentration as body fluids. These are absorbed as quickly as water is. This type of sports drink is used for fluid replacement by athletes.

Benefits:
- Contain sugar for energy
- Increases rate of absorption

Sports drink should be drinken rarely for people who do not participate in sports since they increase the risk of dental caries and weight gain from the high doses of sugar.
