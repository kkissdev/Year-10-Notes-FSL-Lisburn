The performance on sport the quality of their diet and how much they consume can have a dramatic effect. The amount of energy needed depends on the intensity, duration, frequency, type of exercise, age, gender, level of fitness and body fat stores of the individual. Some tips are:

- Eat a varied and balanced diet
- Eat plenty of carbohydrate rich foods
- Eat at least 5 portions of fruit and veg per day
- Start refuelling with carbohydrate and fluid as soon as possible
- Ensure plenty of liquid is consumed before, during and after exercise

The following nutrients are required during physical activity:

- Carbohydrates
- Protein
- Fat
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Fluid

## Carbohydrate

A diet rich in carbohydrate is important for the best performance. Complex carbohydrates are best because they are nutrient dense, filling and low in fat. Excess carbohydrate is stored as glycogen.

Maintained glycogen stores are essential for endurance and stamina. Once these stores are used up, muscles cannot work efficiently, and performance is affected. Athletes may become tired, nauseous or dizzy due to dropping sugar levels. It is important to replenish glycogen stores after exercising with low fat, high-carbohydrate snacks.

While most sportspeople maintain a high carbohydrate diet, those involved in endurance event (long distance running) may increase carbohydrate intake by more than 70 per cent in the three days preceding an event. This is known as 'carbohydrate loading' and, combined with a specialist training programme, it can increase glycogen stores and maximise performance.

## Protein

Most sportspeople can meet their protein requirements by following a balanced diet. Main meals should provide some protein, for example, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, beans, pulses, Quorn and nuts. Only athletes involved in heavy training may need to increase their protein intake in order to gain muscle. This would apply, for example, to weightlifters or those taking part in endurance events, such as marathon runners.

## Fat

A hight fat diet makes it difficult to meet carbohydrate requirements and could affect weight management and energy balance. In particular, saturated fat intake should be monitored.
