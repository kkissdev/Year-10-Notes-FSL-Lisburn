# Unit 1 - Nutrition for Good Health

## Vitamins and Minerals

Proteins, fats and carbs are all macronutrients. This means that they are eaten in large amounts. Vitamins and Minerals are micronutrients. This means they should only be eaten in small portions.

**Minerals**

|Mineral|Function|Sources|Deficiency|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Calcium|- Formation and maintenance of bones and teeth<br>- Necessary for nerve and muscle function<br>- Involved in blood clotting.|- Milk, cheese and other dairy foods.<br>- Green leafy veg (e.g. broccoli or cabbage)<br>- Fortified soya products<br>- White bread<br>- Fish where bones are eaten (e.g. sardines)|- Can reduce peak bone mass, which is a contributory factor in development of osteoporosis in later life|
|Iron|- Forms haemoglobin in red blood cells, which transport oxygen around the body.<br>- Required for normal energy metabolism<br>- Needed for normal functioning of the immune system|Haem Iron (mainly animal sources):<br>- Red meat, liver, chicken, fish<br>Non-Haem Iron (mainly plant sources):<br>- Pulses, nuts, dried fruit, fortified cereals, green leafy veg, wholegrains, eggs.|- Low iron store in the body and eventually iron-deficiency anaemia|
|Sodium|- Helps to balance body fluids<br>- Maintains nerve function|- Table salt<br>- Salty snacks e.g. crisps or nuts<br>- Processed foods like ready-to-eat meals, processed meat products, breakfast cereals<br>- Cheese|- People typically eat too much of this, not the other way around|

Heam Iron has an absorption rate of about 25%, where Non-Heam Iron has 10-15% absorption.

**Vitamins**

|Vitamin|Function|Sources|Deficiency|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A|- Healthy eyesight and skin<br>- Normal growth and development<br>- Healthy immune system<br>- Antioxidant properties, protecting cell damage|Animal (retinol):<br>- Cheese, eggs, oily fish, whole milk, butter, fortified margarine, liver<br>Plant (carotene):<br>- Carrots, green leafy veg, orange fruits|- Night blindness<br>- Dry, flaky skin, frequent infections|
|B1|- Assists with release of energy from food, in particular carbohydrates<br>- Promotes normal functioning of the nervous system, muscles and heart|- Fortified cereals (breakfast cereals and white and brown flour)<br>- Meat<br>- Wholegrains<br>- Nuts|- Don't need to learn it ig|
|C|- Normal structure and function of blood vessels<br>- Helps absorb iron from food, reducing risk of anaemia<br>- Promotes development of connective tissue<br>- Involved in wound healing<br>- Antioxidant properties, protecting cell damage|Fruits and veg, especially:<br>- Blackcurrants, kiwi, oranges, strawberries, lemons, green peppers and broccoli.|- Fatigue<br>- Weakness<br>- Aching joints and muscles<br>- Bleeding gums<br>- Dysfunctional wound healing|
|D|- Helps absorb calcium from food and helps regulate calcium in the body|- Oily fish, eggs, butter, meat, fortified foods (e.g. margarine, breakfast cereals)<br>- Some obtained from sunlight on skin<br>- NO PLANT SOURCES|- Skeletal deformity called rickets in children<br>- Pain and bone weakness called osteomalacia in adults|
