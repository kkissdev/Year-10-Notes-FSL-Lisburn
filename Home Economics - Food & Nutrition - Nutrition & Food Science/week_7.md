# Evaluation for the pasta bake

Pasta Bake Evaluation - [Me - person A]

- *Management/Working Together*

One of our strengths were that we kept to the method. Everyone kept to their tasks and helped each other. For example, when [Person A] finished preparing the saucepan, [Person A] had free time and prepared the saucepan.

One of our weaknesses was organisation. [Person B] chopped the onions badly and put them in the wrong saucepan (which made cooking the chicken harder). We also took the equipment out as we used it, which used up a lot of time.

- *Skills*

We used:
- Chopping veg
- Preparing and cooking chicken
- Grating cheese
- Cooking pasta
- Dicing onion
- Simmering the sauce

Two of our weaknesses were dicing the onion and simmering the sauce. [Person B] had diced the onion very coursely which had made the texture of the finished product worse overall. [Person A] had put the heat too high and the sauce became much thicker than intended.

- *Hygiene and Safety*

One of our strengths were that we were hygienic and worked safely. We all washed our hands and wiped down the table. [Person C] used 2 different cooking board for cooked chicken and raw chicken. We used oven gloves. We were careful with knives and faced our sauce pan handles inward.

- *Finished Dish*

The dish looked good and was colourful. The food was properly cooked. [Person A] would suggest seasoning the chicken. It is suitable for an athletes because it is high in carbs and protein.
