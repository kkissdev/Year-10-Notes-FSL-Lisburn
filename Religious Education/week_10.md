## "God is simply an invention of the human mind"
Agree - 
- Athiests believes that any and all Gods do not exist and are a synthesised concept.
- Humans minds typically link stuff with reasons to make things make sense (e.g. conspiracy theories).
- Steven Hawking said God is a fairy story made by people in the dark.
- Timeline for creation does not fit with the big bang theory.
- Christianity is very ambiguous a many Christians argue about stuff that they should all have similar beliefs in. (Many try to disprove anti-racist/anti-misogynistic comments based on the Bible)
- Innocent suffering, natural evil
- Religious systems are usually self-sealing / unfalsifiable. Arguing for the big bang a Christian could argue back that God created it. Attempting to disprove this usually strengthens their belief. (No piece of evidence could convince a flat-earther that the Earth is round, just make them more conscious that "people are attempting to hoax them into matching beliefs")

Disagree -
- Religious texts - Who wrote them and why?
- Belief/Faith in God and people's lived experience is proof
- Miracle in Bible + today (?)
- First Cause Argument
- Design Argument

## First Cause Argument

1. Cause Chain

> Everything has a cause, nothing can make itself happen but must be caused by something else. Everything is part of a chain of cause and effect and cannot go back to infinity so there must be an uncaused cause which we call God (who says it's the Christian God?).

2. Movement

> Nothing can move by itself but has to be moved by something else. This cannot go back to infiniy otherwise there would be nothing moving therefor there must be an unmoved mover which we call God (no proof of it being the Christian God.)

3. Aquinas

> Aquinas calls the first cause the uncaused cause. The uncaused cause is God (says who?).

4. Dominoes

> The domino analogy is often used to describe the First Cause Argument. There must be an outside force to cause the first domino to fall over and start the chain reaction. Likewise, God was the first cause who created the Universe.\

He took this off of Muslim's and converted it to a Christian argument. Isaac's first law works with the second point.

### Strengths

- This argument is simple - a simple one is usually the correct one (Ockham's razor).
- This argument is logical - if this claim is to be believed, then it is logical to accept that God is the creator of the universe as its simplest explanation.
- This argument is scientific - scientific ideas, such as the Big Bang Theory, can support the First Cause Argument. If God is behind the Big Bang, the God is the 'first cause' that brought the universe into existence.
- rejecting this arguement required something more complicated. Logic states that things exist because something or someone has brought them into existence. So, since the universe exists, it's only logical to assume that someone had cause it to exist. This being must have been omnipotent, eternal, and who is self-sufficient - qualities that can be attributed to God.
- It is supported by major Christian and Muslim thinkers such as Aquinas + Al Ghazali
- It confirms to thiests that there is a purpose to the cosmos.

### Weaknesses
- Aquinas stole the argument off of Muslims
- Hints towards a first cause but does not explicitly link it to God.
- Another attempt at Christians attempting to find links between things.
- Some people look at this argument and conclude that the universe could be eternal and does not require a cause. If the first cause can be eternal, then why can the whole chain of cause and effect not be eternal.
- Science is able to explain the origin of the universe without recourse to God.
- This argument raises the question "Who or what caused God?" To say that God is eternal and has always been in existence is not sufficient to prove God's existence to athiests or agnostics.
- Betrand Russell argues that 'the universe is just there and that's all there is to say." He argued that just because other things have causes, it doesn't mean that the universe must have one too. Just because every human has a mother, it does not follow that the universe has to have a mother.
It is also flawed to argue that God must be the cause behind the Big Bang. Just because we can't be certain about what caused the Bing Bang, it doesn't mean that it is correct to imply that God must have been the cause.
- To make this assumption is to become guilty of what Nietzsche implied was the 'God of The Gaps' perspective. The German theologian Bonhoeffer agreed that this was a flawed appraoch when he said: 'How wrong it is to use God as a stopgap for the incompleteness of our knowledge'.

## The Design Argument
- If you were in the country side and found a watch on the grass you would be impressed by the complexity. Each coil and spring moves precisely together.
- It'd be natural to ask "Who made this?". A complex mechanism implies an intelligent designer.

### Weaknesses

- Observer selection bias - The watch isn't directly connected to your consciousness, which separates it from the universe. If it was, then it would be logical to assume that there are many other universes where the watch doesn't work (and there were no observers to witness it). If the universe couldn't sustain life, we wouldn't be wondering who made this? If the person knew the watch was linked to their consciousness they would have to assume that the watch only works because they exist.
