# Unit 1 - Hinduism

A Brahmin is a priest who lives inside a temple. He looks after the statues of the deities by washing and clothing them. He "feeds" them by placing blessed food at their feet.

For Hindus, Brahman is God or the Supreme Being. Brahman is beyond human understanding. However, Hindus try to explain Brahman through understanding the Hindu scriptures. There are various interpretations, but the main descriptions of Brahman are *Nirguna* and *Saguna*. Nirguna Brahman is the concept that God has no shape or form. This makes Brahman difficult for humans to understand, so Hindus use different ways to represent Brahman, such as the *aum* or *om* symbol The aum or om symbol represents the sound that was present when the world was created. Saguna Brahman is the idea that Brahman has form and can be understood through images. These images are manifestations of God.

The depictions each show a different manifestation of Brahman, where Brahman appears in human or animal form. By looking at the image of a god(des), for example, Shiva, Hindus can understand part of Brahman through seeing his qualities.

## Theistic beliefs

Monotheism is the belief in the existence of only one God, as opposed to polytheism. A person that believes in monotheism is called a monotheist.

Polytheism is the belief in many gods. A person that believe in polytheism is called a polytheist.

Hinduism is polytheistic.
