# Unit 1 - Hinduism

For a Hindu, worship is very important and is something many Hindus do everyday. Worship is a way of showing love and devotion to ***Brahman** (A Hindu God)*. Hindus believe that have an atman, or piece of Brahman, within them. Therefore, connecting to Brahman through worship is very important. Hindus use all of their senses when they worship so that they can fully connect to Brahman. There is one God within Hinduism, Brahman, but there are many different deities through which Brahman is expressed.

Worship can be done within the home or temple. Most Hindus worship at home every day but visit a temple when they want to. Many Hindus also try to visit a temple to celebrate important festivals such as Diwali, the festival of lights.

As there are so many gods in Hinduism, it is not possible for every temple to have a statue of each one. This means that each temples has statues of many popular gods, such as Ganesha and Shiva, but also some statues of gods that are important to the people of that particular community. For example, Hindus who like to worship Vishno will visit temples that contain statues, or murtis, of the ten avatars of vishnu.  
In the main shrine room there is a dome that reaches up high. This is to symbolise the idea that Hindus can reach up to God.

## Visiting a temple

1. Inside a temple everyone must remove their shoes as they should not bring dirt into such a special space. There are areas for worshippers to put their shoes as they come in. Then they enter the main shrine room, in which there are statues of various gods.
2. When they enter the shrine room, Hindus ring a bell to 'awaken' the deities and show them that they are ready to worship. If possible, they will then walk around the main shrine area within the mandir.
3. Next they will either kneel or sit down on the floor infront of the deities, clasp their hands together and offer pranams, or respectful greetings. Showing respect to the deities leads to what is known as dharshan or 'receiving sight' of the deity, who in turn, sees the worshipper. At this point, Hindus might silently recite personal prayers or traditional ancient prayers.
4. Worshippers also give offerings to the gods, such as food and gifts. This to show that gods are respected and to indicate that people are worthy of the gods' attention. Once the oferings of food have been blessed by the temple priest, they are distributed to the visitors.
