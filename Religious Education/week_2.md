# Unit 1 - Hinduism

For a Hindu, worship is very important and is something many Hindus do everyday. Worship is a way of showing love and devotion to ***Brahman** (A Hindu God)*. Hindus believe that have an atman, or piece of Brahman, within them. Therefore, connecting to Brahman through worship is very important. Hindus use all of their senses when they worship so that they can fully connect to Brahman. There is one God within Hinduism, Brahman, but there are many different deities through which Brahman is expressed.

Worship can be done within the home or temple. Most Hindus worship at home every day but visit a temple when they want to. Many Hindus also try to visit a temple to celebrate important festivals such as Diwali, the festival of lights.

As there are so many gods in Hinduism, it is not possible for every temple to have a statue of each one. This means that each temples has statues of many popular gods, such as Ganesha and Shiva, but also some statues of gods that are important to the people of that particular community. For example, Hindus who like to worship Vishno will visit temples that contain statues, or murtis, of the ten avatars of vishnu.  
In the main shrine room there is a dome that reaches up high. This is to symbolise the idea that Hindus can reach up to God.
