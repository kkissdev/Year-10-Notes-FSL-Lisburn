# Unit  1 - Hinduism

## The Afterlife

Life after death is a fundamental belief in most religions. What form life after death takes is different in each religion, and sometime there is a difference of belief between members of the same religion. Some people who are not religious also believe in life after death, while other believe that there is no existence after death. Ways of thinking about life after death include:
- Reincarnation
- Resurrection
- Rebirth
- Immortality as a legacy
- Immortality as a memory of others
- Nothing

## Belief in life after death among non-religious people

Not all people who believe in life after death would call themselves religious. For example, some people believe in the concept of reincarnation who are not necessarily Buddhist, Hindu or Sikh. Others feel natural justice requires good to be rewarded and evil to be punished, but they do not hold on the tradition faiths that promise an afterlife. For some people, near-death experiences (NDEs), as sense of deja vu or feeling they have witnessed ghosts (potentially with medium) convince them there is life beyond death.

## Belief in reincarnation

Most Hindus believe rebirth happens directly at death, but other believe that an atman may exist in other realms. Hindus believe that an atman may enter swarg or narak for a period before rebirth.

Some Hindus believe that humans may be reborn in animal form, and that rebirth from human to animal form only occurs if an atman has repeatedly failed to lean lessons in human form.

Living life according to teachings in the scriptures will eventually lead moksha. Some Hindu scriptures describe moksha as the atman becoming absorbed with Brahman, from where each atman is believed to originate. Other Hindu scriptures describe moksha as living in the realm of personal God. The Maitri Upanishad states the following: 

"Even as water becomes on with water, fire with fire, and air with air, so the atman becomes one with the infinite atman (Brahman) and thus attain final freedom."

## Why do Hindus believe in life after death?

Ancient Hindu scripteures refer to the atman being reborn many times. The Bhagavad Gita states the following:

"As a person casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so does the atman cast off worn out bodies and enter new ones.""

The Bhagavad Gita details four different ways that moksha can be achieved:

- Karma yoga, a type of Hindu religious practice that involves selfless service to others
- Bhakti yoga, the path of loving devotion, aimed at developing pure love of God
- Jnana yoga, a type of Hindu meditation, the path of knowledge that aims at liberation
- Meditation, thinking quietly as a spiritual or religious exercise
