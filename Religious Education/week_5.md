# Unit  1 - Hinduism

## The Afterlife

Life after death is a fundamental belief in most religions. What form life after death takes is different in each religion, and sometime there is a difference of belief between members of the same religion. Some people who are not religious also believe in life after death, while other believe that there is no existence after death. Ways of thinking about life after death include:
- Reincarnation
- Resurrection
- Rebirth
- Immortality as a legacy
- Immortality as a memory of others
- Nothing

## Belief in life after death among non-religious people

Not all people who believe in life after death would call themselves religious. For example, some people believe in the concept of reincarnation who are not necessarily Buddhist, Hindu or Sikh. Others feel natural justice requires good to be rewarded and evil to be punished, but they do not hold on the tradition faiths that promise an afterlife. For some people, near-death experiences (NDEs), as sense of deja vu or feeling they have witnessed ghosts (potentially with medium) convince them there is life beyond death.

## Belief in reincarnation

Most Hindus believe rebirth happens directly at death, but other believe that an atman may exist in other realms. Hindus believe that an atman may enter swarg or narak for a period before rebirth.

Some Hindus believe that humans may be reborn in animal form, and that rebirth from human to animal form only occurs if an atman has repeatedly failed to lean lessons in human form.

Living life according to teachings in the scriptures will eventually lead moksha. Some Hindu scriptures describe moksha as the atman becoming absorbed with Brahman, from where each atman is believed to originate. Other Hindu scriptures describe moksha as living in the realm of personal God. The Maitri Upanishad states the following: 

"Even as water becomes on with water, fire with fire, and air with air, so the atman becomes one with the infinite atman (Brahman) and thus attain final freedom."

## Why do Hindus believe in life after death?

Ancient Hindu scripteures refer to the atman being reborn many times. The Bhagavad Gita states the following:

"As a person casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so does the atman cast off worn out bodies and enter new ones."
- Bhagavad Gita 2:22 (Smirti text)

The Bhagavad Gita details four different ways that moksha can be achieved:

- Karma yoga, a type of Hindu religious practice that involves selfless service to others
- Bhakti yoga, the path of loving devotion, aimed at developing pure love of God
- Jnana yoga, a type of Hindu meditation, the path of knowledge that aims at liberation
- Meditation, thinking quietly as a spiritual or religious exercise 

### What happens after moksha?

There are two main beliefs about what happens after moksha. Some Hindus believe that the atman is absorbed into Brahman. This is because the atman and Brahman are the same. Other Hindus believe that the atman and Brahman are different and that after moksha they remain separate. They believe that the atman will be in the presence of Brahman, as a personal god, but will remain unique and individual.


## GCSE Question

**Explain what one world religion you have studied teaches about reincarnation. (5)**

**Very good Answer**

> "In Hinduism, reincarnation is the belief that when the body dies, the soul (atman) is reborn into another being. This ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is called Samsara. Ancient Hindu scriptures refer to the atman being reborn many times. The Bhagavad Gita states the following: As a person casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so does the atman cast off worn out bodies and enter new ones. Hindus believe that the type of rebirth depends on the karma a person has built up in their previous life. For example, if someone has lived a bad life, they might be reborn as an animal. However, living a good life and doing good deeds creates good karma. Eventually, if a person builds up enough good karma, they can achieve moksha, which is freedom from the cycle of rebirth. THis means the soul returns to Brahman, which is the ultimate goal in Hinduism. Some Hindus also follow the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, which explains that the sould is eternal and simply changes bodies, like changing clothes."

Why this is good specifically:
- **Clear focus on the question:** The answer directly explains Hindu teachings about *reincarnation*, staying fully relevant throughout.  
- **Use of key terminology:** Accurately includes essential Hindu terms — *atman*, *samsara*, *karma*, *moksha*, and *Brahman* — showing strong subject knowledge.  
- **Reference to scripture:** Cites the *Bhagavad Gita* with an appropriate quotation, giving authority and evidence for the explanation.  
- **Logical structure:** Information is clearly sequenced — belief → process → moral implications → ultimate goal — making it easy to follow.  
- **Depth and development:** Goes beyond basic description to explain how actions (karma) influence rebirth and how moksha ends the cycle, showing understanding.  
- **Religious accuracy:** Describes Hindu beliefs faithfully, without confusion or generalisation.  
- **Conclusion reinforces main idea:** Ends by linking back to the eternal nature of the soul, tying the explanation neatly to the central teaching.

Some minor improvements:
- **Could link beliefs to practice:** Doesn’t mention how belief in reincarnation might affect Hindu behaviour or moral choices in daily life.  
- **No topic sentence or summary sentence structure:** Could begin with a clearer introductory statement like “Hinduism teaches that…” to signal focus from the start.  

Question content bucket list:
- Explain what reincarnation is
- Explain Samsara
- Explain Karma
- Explain Moksha

General tips: 

- **Directly answer the question:** Start by restating the key words of the question in your first sentence to stay focused.  
- **Use key terminology:** Include specific religious vocabulary (e.g. karma, salvation, covenant) to show understanding.  
- **Give accurate detail:** Show precise knowledge of what the religion teaches — avoid vague or general statements.  
- **Use evidence or sources:** Include a short quotation or reference to scripture, a key figure, or religious text to support your points.  
- **Explain, don’t just describe:** Make sure you say *why* or *how* a belief matters, not just what it is.  
- **Be concise but complete:** Aim for around 5–7 clear, well-developed sentences — quality over quantity.  
- **Stay focused on one religion:** Don’t mix teachings unless the question asks for comparison.  
- **Finish with a linking sentence:** End by summarising the key belief or teaching to show clear understanding.  
- **Check spelling of key terms:** Misspelling religious terms can lower the impression of accuracy.
