## Religious Education
### Philosophy of Religion
#### Theme 1

**Theist**
> A person who believes in one or more Gods, separate and distinct from people and creatures.

Theism includes monothiesm reffering to the belief in one God and polytheism referring to the belief in the existence of many Gods. It can be used to refer to people who worship more than one God. All thiests believe that at least one god exists. Greek "theos" -> "god" or "deity"

**Atheist**
> A person who does not believe in the existence of God or Gods. An atheist rejects all religious belief and denies the existence of God or a supreme being.

Some atheists adamantly believe that no god exists and try to disprove theistic beliefs. Other atheists simply exercise no faith in God. Some atheists maintan that there is a lack of evidence to affirm God's existence. Others argue that the idea of God's existence is illogical  and contrary to the evidence at hand. Although not all atheists hold the same views, there are some beliefs that many share:
- God, the devil and angels do not exist
- There is no supernatural realm, including ghosts and spirits
- Miracles cannot occur
- Evolution is a scientific fact

**Agnostic**

The word agnostic comes for the Greek *agnostos*, which means to know. Thomas Huxley first used the term agnostic in 1869 to describe someone who believes certain things are unknowable, such as the existence of God.

An Agnostic is not simply a person who has not made up their mind about the existence of God or who cannot decide one way or another. An Agnostic thinks it is impossible to know whether God exists, or at least impossible at the present time. An Agnostic suspends judgement and remains uncertain, saying there is not enough evidence to confirm and deny the existence of God, the afterlife, miracles or anything else supernatural.

##### GCSE Question

**What are the similarities and differences between Atheists and Agnostics? (5)**

- An Agnostic believes we do not have sufficient evidence to either affirm or deny the existence of a deity; it is impossible to know
- An Atheist rejects all belief in a deity.

- The Atheist argues that there is sufficient empirical evidence to reject belief in God and the super natural and that Divine "proofs" are unconvincing
- An Agnostic reserves judgement concerning theistic "proofs".

- Neither agnostics nor atheists actively worship a deity.
