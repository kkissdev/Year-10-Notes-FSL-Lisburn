## How do Hindus Worship?

For Hindus, worship is a daily part of life. Worship expresses devotion and love to the gods and goddesses. Hindus believe that all living beings have atman (a soul), which connects them to Brahman. Devotion to the gods and goddesses, known as Bhakti, is a way of connecting with ultimate reality.

Daily worship is often done at a shrine at home, and sometimes at a mandir. Hindus can also worship at shrines at pilgrimage sits or outdoors in nature.

The four most concepts that Hindus use when worshipping are...

- Havan (fire worship). Hindus worship the god of fire, called Agni, using fire. Hindus burn offerings such as rice while reciting prayers and mantras.

- Puja (Ritual of prayer and devotion). Puja is the general term for Hindu worship and devotion to gods and goddesses. This worship may take place at home or in the mandir.

- Arati (Receiving the blessing of the deities). Arati is a common worship ceremony where Hindus receive the blessings of the deities. Worshippers waft their hands over a flaming ghee lamp and then cover their faces.

- Darshan (to see). Hindu worshippers believe they see and are seen by the deities during worship. They sing hymns, called bhakans or kirtans, and repeat holy phrases and mantras. Prayer beads (known as japa) may also be used.

Hindu families worship at home with a shrine, often in the corner of the best room in the house as a way of honouring the gods and goddesses. Worship at the shrine may involve the whole family, or sometimes it is done alone. A daily puja ceremony uses all five of the senses. For this a Hindu needs the following.
