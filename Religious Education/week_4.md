# Unit 1 - Hinduism

## Atman

Atman is a Hindu word that means 'soul or spirit'. Essentially, it refer to the real person inside an individual. It is made of part of the spirit of Brahman, who Hindus believe is the one true ultimate God. Therefore, it is not something that can be seen or touched, but is eternal and everlasting. This is different from the physical body, or matter, which ca nbe seen and touched. A key Hindu belief is the idea that when a person dies the atman will move on into the body of another being. THhis process is called SAMARA. Hindus believe that the atman is about accumulating knowledge, When the atman moves on to another life, it is as if it is letting go of the ego and gaining true knowledge. 

Hindus believe the physical and material worlds are different. Whereas the physical self exists in this world, the spiritual self exists in the spiritual world. In one of the Hindu scriptures, the Upanishads, there is a story that is used by Hindus to explain the idea of the atman. The story explains that, just like salt in water, you know it is there but cannot see it,. The atman, or part of Brahman, is there even though you cannot see it.

## Free will and suffering

Hindus believe that they have free will. This is the idea that they can act and behave how the wish and are free to make their own choices in life. However, Hinduism has guidelines in the form of gurus, holy scriptures and key concepts. These guidelines show Hindus the morally correct ways to act and behave.

An example of these guidelines is the concept of karma. A Hindu;s actions will result in either goof or bad karma, depending on the action. Hindus believe they should use their free will to act in the best possible way in order to receive good karma. 

Hindus are encouraged to follow the four aims of life, which are artha, kama, moksha and dharma. These aims help a Hindu to act in the right way and to use their free will to follow the lives of Hinduism.


Some Hindus believe that suffering exists due to the karma from people's lives. This could be from moral evil, where humans cause bad things through their own actions, for example by hurting or killing someone else. This causes suffering to other but also bad karma for the person who commits the evil act. As a result, the person might suffer in their next life.

### Author side note

If one cannot remeber the actions in their past lives, are they really the soul, or is the soul just the starter for the body's thinking?

## Karma

The key ideas in Hinduism show good way to live.
If Hindus can gather good karma, then moral action in this life can lead to a better reincarnation in the next life.

### The Law of Karma

Hindus refer to karma as a law.
It is not a law in the criminal sense, like those made by government. 
Instead, it can be likened to the laws of physics. Karma is the idea that actions have consequences.
One thing leads to another ,so what is done today makes a difference tomorrow,.
Karma can also be use by Hindus as an explanation for the below-average aspects of their life and, similarly, the above-average aspects.
Belief in thee law of karma gives Hindus a reason to do good deeds now in order to be rewarded in the next life. The karma that is collected now, which will lead to consequences in the next life, is called kriamana karma.

## The Life cycle

1. The atman is born into a particular place in society with duties to fulfill (dharma)
2. Good or bad karma attaches the soul, depending on the person's choices.
3. At death, the soul is released from the body.
4. After death, the soul is reincarnated. This reincarnation is considered good or bad, depending on karma.
5. Moksha is the ultimate goal for Hindus. They escape from being born again and enter blissfull union with Brahman.

// whole point in life is to stop living more lives?
