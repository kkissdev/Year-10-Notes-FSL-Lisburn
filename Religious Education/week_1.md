## Where did Hinduism begin?

A temple in Hinduism is called a **mandir** and is a special place where Hindus worship. In countries where there are many Hindus, such as India, most towns will have a mandir so all people can worship easily. Hindu temples are decorated elaborately as they represent the idea of a palace, which highlights the idea that God is like a king. The outside of some temples have statues of various deities or scenes from important stories in Hinduism.
