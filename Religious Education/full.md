## Where did Hinduism begin?

A temple in Hinduism is called a **mandir** and is a special place where Hindus worship. In countries where there are many Hindus, such as India, most towns will have a mandir so all people can worship easily. Hindu temples are decorated elaborately as they represent the idea of a palace, which highlights the idea that God is like a king. The outside of some temples have statues of various deities or scenes from important stories in Hinduism.

## Some facts about Hinduism 

- Hinduism wasn't started or inspired by a single person. It started 4,000-5,000 years ago with the river people who lived in the Indus valley. Their traditions developed in the Hindu faith.
- The British use the word Hinduism to describe the religion practised by Indian people.
- Many Hindus refer to their faith as Sanathan Dharma which means spiritual path.
- Its teachings were spread by word of mouth because few people could read at this time in history.
- Some people practise their religion in different ways, some festivals are only celebrated in some parts of the country.
- Hinduism has over 1 billion followers worldwide, with about 95% of Hindus living in India. In the 2025 census, there are 1,020,533 in the UK.

## Worship

For a Hindu, worship is very important and is something many Hindus do everyday. Worship is a way of showing love and devotion to ***Brahman** (A Hindu God)*. Hindus believe that have an atman, or piece of Brahman, within them. Therefore, connecting to Brahman through worship is very important. Hindus use all of their senses when they worship so that they can fully connect to Brahman. There is one God within Hinduism, Brahman, but there are many different deities through which Brahman is expressed.

Worship can be done within the home or temple. Most Hindus worship at home every day but visit a temple when they want to. Many Hindus also try to visit a temple to celebrate important festivals such as Diwali, the festival of lights.

As there are so many gods in Hinduism, it is not possible for every temple to have a statue of each one. This means that each temples has statues of many popular gods, such as Ganesha and Shiva, but also some statues of gods that are important to the people of that particular community. For example, Hindus who like to worship Vishno will visit temples that contain statues, or murtis, of the ten avatars of vishnu.  
In the main shrine room there is a dome that reaches up high. This is to symbolise the idea that Hindus can reach up to God.

### Visiting a temple

1. Inside a temple everyone must remove their shoes as they should not bring dirt into such a special space. There are areas for worshippers to put their shoes as they come in. Then they enter the main shrine room, in which there are statues of various gods.
2. When they enter the shrine room, Hindus ring a bell to 'awaken' the deities and show them that they are ready to worship. If possible, they will then walk around the main shrine area within the mandir.
3. Next they will either kneel or sit down on the floor infront of the deities, clasp their hands together and offer pranams, or respectful greetings. Showing respect to the deities leads to what is known as dharshan or 'receiving sight' of the deity, who in turn, sees the worshipper. At this point, Hindus might silently recite personal prayers or traditional ancient prayers.
4. Worshippers also give offerings to the gods, such as food and gifts. This to show that gods are respected and to indicate that people are worthy of the gods' attention. Once the oferings of food have been blessed by the temple priest, they are distributed to the visitors.

# Unit 1 - Hinduism

A Brahmin is a priest who lives inside a temple. He looks after the statues of the deities by washing and clothing them. He "feeds" them by placing blessed food at their feet.

For Hindus, Brahman is God or the Supreme Being. Brahman is beyond human understanding. However, Hindus try to explain Brahman through understanding the Hindu scriptures. There are various interpretations, but the main descriptions of Brahman are *Nirguna* and *Saguna*. Nirguna Brahman is the concept that God has no shape or form. This makes Brahman difficult for humans to understand, so Hindus use different ways to represent Brahman, such as the *aum* or *om* symbol The aum or om symbol represents the sound that was present when the world was created. Saguna Brahman is the idea that Brahman has form and can be understood through images. These images are manifestations of God.

The depictions each show a different manifestation of Brahman, where Brahman appears in human or animal form. By looking at the image of a god(des), for example, Shiva, Hindus can understand part of Brahman through seeing his qualities.

## Theistic beliefs

Monotheism is the belief in the existence of only one God, as opposed to polytheism. A person that believes in monotheism is called a monotheist.

Polytheism is the belief in many gods. A person that believe in polytheism is called a polytheist.

Hinduism is polytheistic.

## The Trimurti

Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu are the key aspects of Brahman, the Ultimate Reality. The word Trimurti means 'three forms'.

### Brahma

- Creator
- 4 heads which look in all directions
- Arms carry symbols of power
- Least popular of the Trimurti

### Vishnu

- Preserver
- Four arms carry symbols of power
- God of light and enlightment
- Most popular

### Shiva

- Destroyer
- Dancing with four arms
- A drum and a flame
- Necklace of Cobras

# Unit 1 - Hinduism

## Atman

Atman is a Hindu word that means 'soul or spirit'. Essentially, it refer to the real person inside an individual. It is made of part of the spirit of Brahman, who Hindus believe is the one true ultimate God. Therefore, it is not something that can be seen or touched, but is eternal and everlasting. This is different from the physical body, or matter, which ca nbe seen and touched. A key Hindu belief is the idea that when a person dies the atman will move on into the body of another being. THhis process is called SAMARA. Hindus believe that the atman is about accumulating knowledge, When the atman moves on to another life, it is as if it is letting go of the ego and gaining true knowledge. 

Hindus believe the physical and material worlds are different. Whereas the physical self exists in this world, the spiritual self exists in the spiritual world. In one of the Hindu scriptures, the Upanishads, there is a story that is used by Hindus to explain the idea of the atman. The story explains that, just like salt in water, you know it is there but cannot see it,. The atman, or part of Brahman, is there even though you cannot see it.

## Free will and suffering

Hindus believe that they have free will. This is the idea that they can act and behave how the wish and are free to make their own choices in life. However, Hinduism has guidelines in the form of gurus, holy scriptures and key concepts. These guidelines show Hindus the morally correct ways to act and behave.

An example of these guidelines is the concept of karma. A Hindu;s actions will result in either goof or bad karma, depending on the action. Hindus believe they should use their free will to act in the best possible way in order to receive good karma. 

Hindus are encouraged to follow the four aims of life, which are artha, kama, moksha and dharma. These aims help a Hindu to act in the right way and to use their free will to follow the lives of Hinduism.


Some Hindus believe that suffering exists due to the karma from people's lives. This could be from moral evil, where humans cause bad things through their own actions, for example by hurting or killing someone else. This causes suffering to other but also bad karma for the person who commits the evil act. As a result, the person might suffer in their next life.

### Author side note

If one cannot remeber the actions in their past lives, are they really the soul, or is the soul just the starter for the body's thinking?

## Karma

The key ideas in Hinduism show good way to live.
If Hindus can gather good karma, then moral action in this life can lead to a better reincarnation in the next life.

### The Law of Karma

Hindus refer to karma as a law.
It is not a law in the criminal sense, like those made by government. 
Instead, it can be likened to the laws of physics. Karma is the idea that actions have consequences.
One thing leads to another ,so what is done today makes a difference tomorrow,.
Karma can also be use by Hindus as an explanation for the below-average aspects of their life and, similarly, the above-average aspects.
Belief in thee law of karma gives Hindus a reason to do good deeds now in order to be rewarded in the next life. The karma that is collected now, which will lead to consequences in the next life, is called kriamana karma.

## The Life cycle

1. The atman is born into a particular place in society with duties to fulfill (dharma)
2. Good or bad karma attaches the soul, depending on the person's choices.
3. At death, the soul is released from the body.
4. After death, the soul is reincarnated. This reincarnation is considered good or bad, depending on karma.
5. Moksha is the ultimate goal for Hindus. They escape from being born again and enter blissfull union with Brahman.

// whole point in life is to stop living more lives?

# Unit  1 - Hinduism

## The Afterlife

Life after death is a fundamental belief in most religions. What form life after death takes is different in each religion, and sometime there is a difference of belief between members of the same religion. Some people who are not religious also believe in life after death, while other believe that there is no existence after death. Ways of thinking about life after death include:
- Reincarnation
- Resurrection
- Rebirth
- Immortality as a legacy
- Immortality as a memory of others
- Nothing

## Belief in life after death among non-religious people

Not all people who believe in life after death would call themselves religious. For example, some people believe in the concept of reincarnation who are not necessarily Buddhist, Hindu or Sikh. Others feel natural justice requires good to be rewarded and evil to be punished, but they do not hold on the tradition faiths that promise an afterlife. For some people, near-death experiences (NDEs), as sense of deja vu or feeling they have witnessed ghosts (potentially with medium) convince them there is life beyond death.

## Belief in reincarnation

Most Hindus believe rebirth happens directly at death, but other believe that an atman may exist in other realms. Hindus believe that an atman may enter swarg or narak for a period before rebirth.

Some Hindus believe that humans may be reborn in animal form, and that rebirth from human to animal form only occurs if an atman has repeatedly failed to lean lessons in human form.

Living life according to teachings in the scriptures will eventually lead moksha. Some Hindu scriptures describe moksha as the atman becoming absorbed with Brahman, from where each atman is believed to originate. Other Hindu scriptures describe moksha as living in the realm of personal God. The Maitri Upanishad states the following: 

"Even as water becomes on with water, fire with fire, and air with air, so the atman becomes one with the infinite atman (Brahman) and thus attain final freedom."

## Why do Hindus believe in life after death?

Ancient Hindu scripteures refer to the atman being reborn many times. The Bhagavad Gita states the following:

"As a person casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so does the atman cast off worn out bodies and enter new ones."
- Bhagavad Gita 2:22 (Smirti text)

The Bhagavad Gita details four different ways that moksha can be achieved:

- Karma yoga, a type of Hindu religious practice that involves selfless service to others
- Bhakti yoga, the path of loving devotion, aimed at developing pure love of God
- Jnana yoga, a type of Hindu meditation, the path of knowledge that aims at liberation
- Meditation, thinking quietly as a spiritual or religious exercise 

### What happens after moksha?

There are two main beliefs about what happens after moksha. Some Hindus believe that the atman is absorbed into Brahman. This is because the atman and Brahman are the same. Other Hindus believe that the atman and Brahman are different and that after moksha they remain separate. They believe that the atman will be in the presence of Brahman, as a personal god, but will remain unique and individual.


## GCSE Question

**Explain what one world religion you have studied teaches about reincarnation. (5)**

**Very good Answer**

> "In Hinduism, reincarnation is the belief that when the body dies, the soul (atman) is reborn into another being. This ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is called Samsara. Ancient Hindu scriptures refer to the atman being reborn many times. The Bhagavad Gita states the following: As a person casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so does the atman cast off worn out bodies and enter new ones. Hindus believe that the type of rebirth depends on the karma a person has built up in their previous life. For example, if someone has lived a bad life, they might be reborn as an animal. However, living a good life and doing good deeds creates good karma. Eventually, if a person builds up enough good karma, they can achieve moksha, which is freedom from the cycle of rebirth. THis means the soul returns to Brahman, which is the ultimate goal in Hinduism. Some Hindus also follow the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, which explains that the sould is eternal and simply changes bodies, like changing clothes."

Why this is good specifically:
- **Clear focus on the question:** The answer directly explains Hindu teachings about *reincarnation*, staying fully relevant throughout.  
- **Use of key terminology:** Accurately includes essential Hindu terms — *atman*, *samsara*, *karma*, *moksha*, and *Brahman* — showing strong subject knowledge.  
- **Reference to scripture:** Cites the *Bhagavad Gita* with an appropriate quotation, giving authority and evidence for the explanation.  
- **Logical structure:** Information is clearly sequenced — belief → process → moral implications → ultimate goal — making it easy to follow.  
- **Depth and development:** Goes beyond basic description to explain how actions (karma) influence rebirth and how moksha ends the cycle, showing understanding.  
- **Religious accuracy:** Describes Hindu beliefs faithfully, without confusion or generalisation.  
- **Conclusion reinforces main idea:** Ends by linking back to the eternal nature of the soul, tying the explanation neatly to the central teaching.

Some minor improvements:
- **Could link beliefs to practice:** Doesn’t mention how belief in reincarnation might affect Hindu behaviour or moral choices in daily life.  
- **No topic sentence or summary sentence structure:** Could begin with a clearer introductory statement like “Hinduism teaches that…” to signal focus from the start.  

Question content bucket list:
- Explain what reincarnation is
- Explain Samsara
- Explain Karma
- Explain Moksha

General tips: 

- **Directly answer the question:** Start by restating the key words of the question in your first sentence to stay focused.  
- **Use key terminology:** Include specific religious vocabulary (e.g. karma, salvation, covenant) to show understanding.  
- **Give accurate detail:** Show precise knowledge of what the religion teaches — avoid vague or general statements.  
- **Use evidence or sources:** Include a short quotation or reference to scripture, a key figure, or religious text to support your points.  
- **Explain, don’t just describe:** Make sure you say *why* or *how* a belief matters, not just what it is.  
- **Be concise but complete:** Aim for around 5–7 clear, well-developed sentences — quality over quantity.  
- **Stay focused on one religion:** Don’t mix teachings unless the question asks for comparison.  
- **Finish with a linking sentence:** End by summarising the key belief or teaching to show clear understanding.  
- **Check spelling of key terms:** Misspelling religious terms can lower the impression of accuracy.

## What are the Hindu Holy books?

### Hindu Sacred Writings

Many of the teachings and ideas about Brahman, the gods and goddesses come from Hindu scriptures. Some religions have one holy book but Hinduism has many different books. Different Hindu communities use different scriptures, as Hinduism is such a diverse religion. There are two main groups of texts - the Shruti (which means heard) and the Smriti (which means remembered):

- Shruti - The Shruti texts are the most ancient in Hindu Scripture. They include the four Vedas, which are collections of poems and hymns from over 3,000 years ago. The collection is often studied by scholars and priests.

- Smriti - The Smriti texts interpret the Vedas and provide ideas on how they can be applied to people's lives. Examples of Smriti texts are the Puranas, the Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita. Ordinary Hindus (people who are not scholars or priests) tend to read these scriptues more often than the Vedas.

### Ramayana

One key example of Hindu scripture is the Ramayana, which tells the story of Prince Rama and Princess Sita. This story is celebrated at the festival of Diwali. The Ramayana is a huge epic poem full of stories.

**The Story**

- Dasartha, the King, was growing old and wanted to name his successor. 
- He chose his eldest son, Rama, but the queen wanted her son, Bharata, to be King instead. 
- The King kept his promise to grant the queen a wish because she had saved his life earlier. 
- The queen's son (Bharta) became King and Rama was sent out of the Kingdom for fourteen years. 
- However, the queen's son refused to be crowned King and placed Rama's slippers on the throne until he returned.

- The holy man was actually Ravana, the ten-headed demon god, who took Sita prisoner in his castle on the island of Lanka. 
- Rama and Lakshmana helped by Hanuman, the monkey god, and his army of monkeys, made a bridge to the island of Lanka. 
- A big battle took place and Ravana was killed by an arrow from Rama. 
- Rama and Sita were welcomed home and Rama was crowned King. Oil lamps were lit everywhere.

Condensed:
- Dasartha wants Rama to be his successor

# Unit 1 - Hinduism

## How do Hindus Worship?

For Hindus, worship is a daily part of life. Worship expresses devotion and love to the gods and goddesses. Hindus believe that all living beings have atman (a soul), which connects them to Brahman. Devotion to the gods and goddesses, known as Bhakti, is a way of connecting with ultimate reality.

Daily worship is often done at a shrine at home, and sometimes at a mandir. Hindus can also worship at shrines at pilgrimage sits or outdoors in nature.

The four most concepts that Hindus use when worshipping are...

- Havan (fire worship). Hindus worship the god of fire, called Agni, using fire. Hindus burn offerings such as rice while reciting prayers and mantras.

- Puja (Ritual of prayer and devotion). Puja is the general term for Hindu worship and devotion to gods and goddesses. This worship may take place at home or in the mandir.

- Arati (Receiving the blessing of the deities). Arati is a common worship ceremony where Hindus receive the blessings of the deities. Worshippers waft their hands over a flaming ghee lamp and then cover their faces.

- Darshan (to see). Hindu worshippers believe they see and are seen by the deities during worship. They sing hymns, called bhakans or kirtans, and repeat holy phrases and mantras. Prayer beads (known as japa) may also be used.

Hindu families worship at home with a shrine, often in the corner of the best room in the house as a way of honouring the gods and goddesses. Worship at the shrine may involve the whole family, or sometimes it is done alone. A daily puja ceremony uses all five of the senses. For this a Hindu needs the following.

|Object|Sense|Use in worship|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bell|Hearing|To awaken the god or goddess and symbolise the beginning of the worship|
|Food|Tasting|The make a gift, fruit or other food is placed at the shrine as an offering to the deity.|
|Murti|Seeing|An image of the god or goddess being worshipped.|
|Incence and Flowers|Smelling|Burning incense sticks fill the room with scent, symbolising the presence of the deity. Flowers are often placed in the shrine to honour the deity.|
|Kum-Kum powder|Touching|Making a coloured mark on the worshipper's forehead shows honour to the deity and reminds the worshipper of their devotion throughout the day.|

# Unit 1 - Hinduism

## Diwali

1. All religious festivals connect ancient stories to modern rituals and involve communities gathering to remember, commit and worship.
2. The word "Diwali" means "Full of lights". This is why it is called the Festival of Lights.
3. The festival celebrates the victory of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance

4. The festival is a celebration of good over evil because Holika was burnt in a fire when she tried to kill Prahlad.
5. There are several stories associated with Holi. Some people believe the origin of the festival lies with Lord Krishna. In Hindu scriptures he is described as a very mischievous young boy. Stories include throwing colour water over the maids and even stealing their clothes while they were bathing in a river.
6. The practical jokes and paint fights, which are now a common feature of Holi, are thought to come from these stories.
7. The story of Prahlad symbolises good overcoming evil and is why bonfires are traditionally lit at Holi.
8. Prahlad refused to worship the King and worshipped God in the form of Lord Vishnu instead.
9. Ashes from Holi bonfires are thought by some Hindus to bring good luck.
10. Holi is an opportunity for some Hindus to think about the things they can learn from scriptue and they are reminded of the importance of staying true to their beliefs, as Prince Prahlad did.

# GCSEs
## Religious Education
### Philosophy of Religion
#### Theme 1

**Theist**
> A person who believes in one or more Gods, separate and distinct from people and creatures.

Theism includes monothiesm reffering to the belief in one God and polytheism referring to the belief in the existence of many Gods. It can be used to refer to people who worship more than one God. All thiests believe that at least one god exists. Greek "theos" -> "god" or "deity"

**Atheist**
> A person who does not believe in the existence of God or Gods. An atheist rejects all religious belief and denies the existence of God or a supreme being.

Some atheists adamantly believe that no god exists and try to disprove theistic beliefs. Other atheists simply exercise no faith in God. Some atheists maintan that there is a lack of evidence to affirm God's existence. Others argue that the idea of God's existence is illogical  and contrary to the evidence at hand. Although not all atheists hold the same views, there are some beliefs that many share:
- God, the devil and angels do not exist
- There is no supernatural realm, including ghosts and spirits
- Miracles cannot occur
- Evolution is a scientific fact

**Agnostic**

The word agnostic comes for the Greek *agnostos*, which means to know. Thomas Huxley first used the term agnostic in 1869 to describe someone who believes certain things are unknowable, such as the existence of God.

An Agnostic is not simply a person who has not made up their mind about the existence of God or who cannot decide one way or another. An Agnostic thinks it is impossible to know whether God exists, or at least impossible at the present time. An Agnostic suspends judgement and remains uncertain, saying there is not enough evidence to confirm and deny the existence of God, the afterlife, miracles or anything else supernatural.

##### GCSE Question

**What are the similarities and differences between Atheists and Agnostics? (5)**

- An Agnostic believes we do not have sufficient evidence to either affirm or deny the existence of a deity; it is impossible to know
- An Atheist rejects all belief in a deity.

- The Atheist argues that there is sufficient empirical evidence to reject belief in God and the super natural and that Divine "proofs" are unconvincing
- An Agnostic reserves judgement concerning theistic "proofs".

- Neither agnostics nor atheists actively worship a deity.

## "God is simply an invention of the human mind"
Agree - 
- Athiests believes that any and all Gods do not exist and are a synthesised concept.
- Humans minds typically link stuff with reasons to make things make sense (e.g. conspiracy theories).
- Steven Hawking said God is a fairy story made by people in the dark.
- Timeline for creation does not fit with the big bang theory.
- Christianity is very ambiguous a many Christians argue about stuff that they should all have similar beliefs in. (Many try to disprove anti-racist/anti-misogynistic comments based on the Bible)
- Innocent suffering, natural evil
- Religious systems are usually self-sealing / unfalsifiable. Arguing for the big bang a Christian could argue back that God created it. Attempting to disprove this usually strengthens their belief. (No piece of evidence could convince a flat-earther that the Earth is round, just make them more conscious that "people are attempting to hoax them into matching beliefs")

Disagree -
- Religious texts - Who wrote them and why?
- Belief/Faith in God and people's lived experience is proof
- Miracle in Bible + today (?)
- First Cause Argument
- Design Argument

## First Cause Argument

1. Cause Chain

> Everything has a cause, nothing can make itself happen but must be caused by something else. Everything is part of a chain of cause and effect and cannot go back to infinity so there must be an uncaused cause which we call God (who says it's the Christian God?).

2. Movement

> Nothing can move by itself but has to be moved by something else. This cannot go back to infiniy otherwise there would be nothing moving therefor there must be an unmoved mover which we call God (no proof of it being the Christian God.)

3. Aquinas

> Aquinas calls the first cause the uncaused cause. The uncaused cause is God (says who?).

4. Dominoes

> The domino analogy is often used to describe the First Cause Argument. There must be an outside force to cause the first domino to fall over and start the chain reaction. Likewise, God was the first cause who created the Universe.\

He took this off of Muslim's and converted it to a Christian argument. Isaac's first law works with the second point.

### Strengths

- This argument is simple - a simple one is usually the correct one (Ockham's razor).
- This argument is logical - if this claim is to be believed, then it is logical to accept that God is the creator of the universe as its simplest explanation.
- This argument is scientific - scientific ideas, such as the Big Bang Theory, can support the First Cause Argument. If God is behind the Big Bang, the God is the 'first cause' that brought the universe into existence.
- rejecting this arguement required something more complicated. Logic states that things exist because something or someone has brought them into existence. So, since the universe exists, it's only logical to assume that someone had cause it to exist. This being must have been omnipotent, eternal, and who is self-sufficient - qualities that can be attributed to God.
- It is supported by major Christian and Muslim thinkers such as Aquinas + Al Ghazali
- It confirms to thiests that there is a purpose to the cosmos.

### Weaknesses
- Aquinas stole the argument off of Muslims
- Hints towards a first cause but does not explicitly link it to God.
- Another attempt at Christians attempting to find links between things.
- Some people look at this argument and conclude that the universe could be eternal and does not require a cause. If the first cause can be eternal, then why can the whole chain of cause and effect not be eternal.
- Science is able to explain the origin of the universe without recourse to God.
- This argument raises the question "Who or what caused God?" To say that God is eternal and has always been in existence is not sufficient to prove God's existence to athiests or agnostics.
- Betrand Russell argues that 'the universe is just there and that's all there is to say." He argued that just because other things have causes, it doesn't mean that the universe must have one too. Just because every human has a mother, it does not follow that the universe has to have a mother.
It is also flawed to argue that God must be the cause behind the Big Bang. Just because we can't be certain about what caused the Bing Bang, it doesn't mean that it is correct to imply that God must have been the cause.
- To make this assumption is to become guilty of what Nietzsche implied was the 'God of The Gaps' perspective. The German theologian Bonhoeffer agreed that this was a flawed appraoch when he said: 'How wrong it is to use God as a stopgap for the incompleteness of our knowledge'.

## The Design Argument
- If you were in the country side and found a watch on the grass you would be impressed by the complexity. Each coil and spring moves precisely together.
- It'd be natural to ask "Who made this?". A complex mechanism implies an intelligent designer.

### Weaknesses

- Observer selection bias - The watch isn't directly connected to your consciousness, which separates it from the universe. If it was, then it would be logical to assume that there are many other universes where the watch doesn't work (and there were no observers to witness it). If the universe couldn't sustain life, we wouldn't be wondering who made this? If the person knew the watch was linked to their consciousness they would have to assume that the watch only works because they exist.
