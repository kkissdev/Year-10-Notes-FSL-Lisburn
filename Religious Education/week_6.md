## What are the Hindu Holy books?

### Hindu Sacred Writings

Many of the teachings and ideas about Brahman, the gods and goddesses come from Hindu scriptures. Some religions have one holy book but Hinduism has many different books. Different Hindu communities use different scriptures, as Hinduism is such a diverse religion. There are two main groups of texts - the Shruti (which means heard) and the Smriti (which means remembered):

- Shruti - The Shruti texts are the most ancient in Hindu Scripture. They include the four Vedas, which are collections of poems and hymns from over 3,000 years ago. The collection is often studied by scholars and priests.

- Smriti - The Smriti texts interpret the Vedas and provide ideas on how they can be applied to people's lives. Examples of Smriti texts are the Puranas, the Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita. Ordinary Hindus (people who are not scholars or priests) tend to read these scriptues more often than the Vedas.

### Ramayana

One key example of Hindu scripture is the Ramayana, which tells the story of Prince Rama and Princess Sita. This story is celebrated at the festival of Diwali. The Ramayana is a huge epic poem full of stories.

**The Story**

- Dasartha, the King, was growing old and wanted to name his successor. 
- He chose his eldest son, Rama, but the queen wanted her son, Bharata, to be King instead. 
- The King kept his promise to grant the queen a wish because she had saved his life earlier. 
- The queen's son (Bharta) became King and Rama was sent out of the Kingdom for fourteen years. 
- However, the queen's son refused to be crowned King and placed Rama's slippers on the throne until he returned. 
- Rama, Sita (Rama's wife) and Lakshmana (his brother) lived in the forest for fourteen years. 
- Rama and Lakshmana went out hunting and left out Sita in a protective magic circle. 
- Sita was tricked out of the circle by a begging holy man. 
- The holy man was actually Ravana, the ten-headed demon god, who took Sita prisoner in his castle on the island of Lanka. 
- Rama and Lakshmana helped by Hanuman, the monkey god, and his army of monkeys, made a bridge to the island of Lanka. 
- A big battle took place and Ravana was killed by an arrow from Rama.
