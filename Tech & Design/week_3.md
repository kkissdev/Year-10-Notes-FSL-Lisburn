## PCB Manufacture

The main steps in the process of manufacturing a PCB are a follows:
- Design your PCB layout on the computer
- Print out the artwork to place on the PCB
- Expose PCB to UV light
- Place PCB in developing solution
- Wash PCB
- Place PCB in etching solution
- Wash PCB
- Drill and solder components

A PCB has two sides: the Track and the Component side.

- Print mask onto acetate
- Cut PCB board to size using a guilotine
- Remove rubber coating
- Expose to UV light, using a light box for approx. 2-5 minutes
- Developer Solutiong (30-60 secs)
- Wash off the coating/where it was exposed to UV light
- Etch - approx. 7-15 to remove unwanted copper
- Wash to get rid of the harmful substance
- Drill holes using PCB drill (1mm bit)
- Silicon screen press

## Circuit Wizard
For input and output cells, they use digital cells: on and off. Analogue signals also exist: high and low.
