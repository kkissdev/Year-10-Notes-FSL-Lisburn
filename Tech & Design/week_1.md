## Integrated Circuits (ICs)

Our world is full of *Intergrated Circuits (ICs)*. Most modern devices will use atleast one IC. A computer will have many of these, its most sophisticated being the *microprocessor*. Its job is to process all the information in the computer. It keeps track of what keys are pressed the movement of the mouse. It can count numbers and runs programs and the OS (operating system).

## The History of Electrical Products

Some of the earliest products contained thermionic valves. These allowed products like radios and TVs to exist but they were very bulky and used a lot of power.

The succesor to the thermionic valve was the *Transistor*. Transistors were much smaller and also consumed much less power. This allowed the invention of products such as the tranistor radio, which was compact and portable. The next significant breakthrough was the invention of the Integrated Circuit. This was a real game changer as it allowed a *whole circuit to be manufactured on one small device*. ICs contain very small chips of silicon, into which numerous components are formed. Each silicon chip is mounted in a *plastic case* and is connexted to the *pins* in the side of the case.

So the IC is actually a complex circuit which contains anywhere from hundreds to millions of electrical components such as resistors, capacitors and transistors. These are connected by metal strips to make up the circuit.
