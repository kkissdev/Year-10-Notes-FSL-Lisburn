# Unit 1 - Designing a Computer-Controlled Reaction Game

## Basic Rules

Italics are highlighted phrases, bold words are found and explained in the [Key Terms](#keyterms).

## Learning outcomes

- Understand what an *Integrated Circuit* is and how it is constructed.
- Understand how electrical technology has developed over time and the importance of ***miniaturisation***.
- *Recognise* and be able to *identify pin numbers* on a ***DIL chip***.
- Understand what a *PIC Microcontroller* is and how it is used.
- Be able to use the basic commands in Circuit Wizard and create a *functional flowsheet*.
- *Design and download a personalised program* to the *Reaction Game **PCB***.
- Understand how a ***PCB*** is *manufactured*.

## Integrated Circuits (ICs)

Our world is full of *Intergrated Circuits (ICs)*. Most modern devices will use atleast one IC. A computer will have many of these, its most sophisticated being the *microprocessor*. Its job is to process all the information in the computer. It keeps track of what keys are pressed the movement of the mouse. It can count numbers and runs programs and the OS (operating system).
