# Unit 1 - Designing a Computer-Controlled Reaction Game

Current circuits used in Tech and Design have been made of discrete or separate components. Integrated circuits are complete circuit in themselves.

The inventions of the IC was of great significance because it allowed complex electronic circuits to be made in a single small component.

The first working IC was produced in 1958. These first chips were used in defence and space equipment - they were at this tage very expensive to produc and could only be afforded by governments of more wealthy countries.

By 1963 ICs were starting to appear in commercial products such as hearing aids and calculators.

Even today, manufacturers are getting better at miniaturising ICs - think how small and intelligent your mobile phone is. This is achieved by packing complex circuitry onto a number of tiny ICs inside your phone.

## Construction of an IC

Silicon Chip - Using precision equipment, the various components which make up the circuit are formed on the tiny piece of silicon. A layer of metal is then printed on to connect up the components.

Plastic Case - This protects the silicon chip from damage and dust/dirt.

Notch/Dot - helps user to identify pin numbers on IC.

Metal Pins - Allow the IC to be plugged into a PCB

### Pin Layouts

In order to use an IC, we must be able to identify the legs or pins of the component. The IC we will use in the reaction game project has 8 legs but it is not unusal for an IC to have more.
