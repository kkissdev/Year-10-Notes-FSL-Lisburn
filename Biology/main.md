## Disease

Health is defined as being free from communicable and non-communicable disease.
- **Communicable Disease** - a disease that can be passed from one living organism to another (an **infectious** disease) (like malaria)
- **Non-Communicable Disease** - a disease that is not passed from one living organism to another (like cancer)

### Communicable Diseases

Most communicable diseases are caused by microorganisms (microbes).  
An organism that can cause disease is called a pathogen.  
There are three main types of **disease-causing (pathogenic) microorganism**:
- Bacteria
- Viruses
- Fungi

#### 1. Bacteria

Bacteria are single celled organisms.

# **********INSERT DIAGRAM HERE**********

It is similar to animal and plant cells with its cytoplasm and cell membrane. However, it is different from them because it has plasmids while they don't, bacteria have non-cellulose cell walls, while animal cells dont and plant cells have cellulose walls, and bacteria have no nucleus unlike plants and animals.

Bacterial pathogens cause communicable diseases like salmonella and tuberculosis.

##### Salmonella

Salmonella food poisoning is an illness that can occur if living Salmonella bacteria enter the body. It can be found in raw meats, poultry and eggs. You can get it by eating contaminated foods. It can be prevented by avoiding not throughly cooked foods, or cross-contaminated foods.

It can be treated with antibiotics (which only kill bacteria)

##### Tuberculosis

It is airborne and spread through inhaling drops of saliva from coughs or sneezes of an infected person (droplet infection).

It can be treated with antibiotics (which only kill bacteria)

### 2. Viruses

Viruses also cause many communicable diseases. The cold, the flu and HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) are all viruses.

- Colds and Flu
Colds and Flu share some symptoms, but are caused by different viruses. Both are airborne and spread by droplet infection. There is a flu vaccination for targeted groups of people, e.g. elderly, pregnant, caretakers, children etc.

- Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)
HPV is spread through sexual contact. Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer or others. The HPV vaccination protects against the types of HPV.

### 3. Fungi

**Athlete's foot**

It is a common condition cause by a fungal infection. It spreads easily. It can be passed from person to person through contact in contaminates towels, clothing or surfaces where **spores** are present. They multiply in warm, humid conditions such as showers, swimming polls and changing rooms. Infection risk can be reduced by avoiding direct contact in areas where spores are likely to be present.
