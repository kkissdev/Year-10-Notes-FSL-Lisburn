## Defence mechanisms of the body
### Defence against microorganisms that have entered the body

#### Antibodies

Antigens are chemical markers on the surface of a microbe that alert the lymphocyte to produce matching complementary antibodies.

**Antigen = antibody-generating substances**

- The lymphocytes produce antibodies whose shapes are complimentary to the shape of the antigens on the microbe
- The antibodies immobilise the microbes, clumping them together. This also stops reproduction.

The immobilisation of these pathogens reduce the spread of disease and their symptoms.


#### Phagocytosis by Phagocytes

Special white blood cells called phagocytes destroy microorganisms by engulfing and digesting them. (enzymes inside the phagocytes digest the microorganisms and destroy them.) The process is called phagocytosis. Phagocytes can sqeeze out of blood capillaries and move around the body to the site of infection. If the skin is cut or grazed, for example, phagocytes will collect at the site of damage to destroy any microorganisms that might get in. Phagocytes can destroy microorganisms that are immobilised or clumped by antibodies.

Both lymphocytes and phagocytes can work together by first clumping the cells together and then digesting them.

## Immunity

### Primary and Secondary Responses

The primary immune response happens when someone encounters an antigen for they very first time. During a primary infection the level of antibodies slowly increases, peaks at a relative low level and then decreases relative quickly. The infected individual is usually ill. When an individual encounters an antigen, their body produces memory lymphocytes (memory cells). Memory lymphocytes remain in the body for many yearsd and assist with future immune responses if the same antigen is encountered again.

The secondary response happens when an individual responds to a previously encountered antigen. (It could be the individual's second or third or... etc. time encountering the particular antigen) The Immune system will already have produced memory lymphocytes and they will still be present in the body. The memory lymphocytes will be able to produce a high level of antibodies very quickly and the level will remain high for a long period of time. An individual is often unaware when the secondary response occurs because they may not symptoms i.e. they may not catch the disease/become ill.

Individuals who are protected against a particular infection or disease are described as being immune the the diseas. If a person is immune it means that their antibody levels are hight enough, or high enough levels can be produced quickly enough, to combat the microorganism if it enters the body again.

### Vaccinations

Vaccinations make individuals immuns to diseases. Vaccines contain antigens. The body's lymphocytes produce antibodies in response to the antigen present in the vaccine. Memory lymphocytes will also be produced. This is the primary response. If the microorganism with the same antigens is encountered again, after the vaccine, the memory lymphocytes will produce large numbers of the antibody very quickly. The individual will not get sick because the pathogen will be killed before it has the chance to breed and spread through the body. This is the secondary response. 

Sometimes a booster vaccination is needed to maintain the high levels of antibodies needed to provide immunity.

An individual with memory lymphocytes for a particular infection will be immune to it.

In 1976, a scientist Edward Jenner developed a vaccine that would prevent people from catching smallpox. Smallpox was a very deadly disease. It killed more children each year than any other disease and also killed many thousands of adults.
