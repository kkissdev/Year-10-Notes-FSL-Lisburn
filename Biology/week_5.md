### Defence against microorganisms that have entered the body

#### Antibodies

Antigens are chemical markers on the surface of a microbe that alert the lymphocyte to produce matching complementary antibodies.

**Antigen = antibody-generating substances

- The lymphocytes produce antibodies whose shapes are complimentary to the shape of the antigens on the microbe
- The antibodies immobilise the microbes, clumping them together. This also stops reproduction.
