# Unit 2 - Genetics

The passing on of family characteristics from parents to offspring is called inheritance. Genetics is the scientific study of inheritance.

## Genetic Information

The genome is the entire genetic material of an organism. Genetic material is stored in the nucleus. The nuvleus contains structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes are thin strands of DNA. Chromosomes are subdivided into smaller sections called genes. There aare hundreds of genes in each chromosome. A gene is a short length of DNA that codes for a particular characteristic.

Organisms' characteristics are passed on from the generation to generation by genes, for examples fur colours in mice and eye colour in humans. Genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis can also be passed on from parents to offspring by genes.

Normally, chromosomes occur in functional pairs. The chromosome in a paire are called homologous (same, position) chromosomes. One chromosome originates from the mother, and the other originates from the father.

The chromosomes in a homologous pair have the same genes in the same order, but there might be a variation in the forms of the genes. For example, both chromosomes in a homologous pair could have the gener for eye colours, but on one chromosome the gene could code for blue, while on the other it could code for brown. Different forms of the same gene are called alleles. Genes work in pairs.
