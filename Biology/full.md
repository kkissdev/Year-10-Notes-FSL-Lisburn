## Disease

Health is defined as being free from communicable and non-communicable disease.
- **Communicable Disease** - a disease that can be passed from one living organism to another (an **infectious** disease) (like malaria)
- **Non-Communicable Disease** - a disease that is not passed from one living organism to another (like cancer)

### Communicable Diseases

Most communicable diseases are caused by microorganisms (microbes).  
An organism that can cause disease is called a pathogen.  
There are three main types of **disease-causing (pathogenic) microorganism**:
- Bacteria
- Viruses
- Fungi

#### 1. Bacteria

Bacteria are single celled organisms.

# **********INSERT DIAGRAM HERE**********

It is similar to animal and plant cells with its cytoplasm and cell membrane. However, it is different from them because it has plasmids while they don't, bacteria have non-cellulose cell walls, while animal cells dont and plant cells have cellulose walls, and bacteria have no nucleus unlike plants and animals.

Bacterial pathogens cause communicable diseases like salmonella and tuberculosis.

##### Salmonella

Salmonella food poisoning is an illness that can occur if living Salmonella bacteria enter the body. It can be found in raw meats, poultry and eggs. You can get it by eating contaminated foods. It can be prevented by avoiding not throughly cooked foods, or cross-contaminated foods.

It can be treated with antibiotics (which only kill bacteria)

##### Tuberculosis

It is airborne and spread through inhaling drops of saliva from coughs or sneezes of an infected person (droplet infection).

It can be treated with antibiotics (which only kill bacteria)

## Communicable Diseases

### 2. Viruses

Viruses also cause many communicable diseases. The cold, the flu and HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) are all viruses.

- Colds and Flu
Colds and Flu share some symptoms, but are caused by different viruses. Both are airborne and spread by droplet infection. There is a flu vaccination for targeted groups of people, e.g. elderly, pregnant, caretakers, children etc.

- Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)
HPV is spread through sexual contact. Some types of HPV can cause cervical cancer or others. The HPV vaccination protects against the types of HPV.

### 3. Fungi

**Athlete's foot**

It is a common condition cause by a fungal infection. It spreads easily. It can be passed from person to person through contact in contaminates towels, clothing or surfaces where **spores** are present. They multiply in warm, humid conditions such as showers, swimming polls and changing rooms. Infection risk can be reduced by avoiding direct contact in areas where spores are likely to be present.

## Defence mechanisms of the body

The body is very good at preventing most microorganisms from gaining entry and effectively defending itself against those microorganisms that do enter.

 - The skin is an excellent physical barrier between the body and the surrounding external environment. It stops most pathogenic microbes from entering.
 - Mucous membranes line the respiratory system. They secrete mucus which traps microorganisms and stops them going any further. The mucus and trapped material are then moved by cilia to the throat where they are swallowed and then pass out of the body harmlessly
 - Blood clotting seal wounds and act as a barrier against infection. Platelets play a role in converting the soluble protein fibrinogen (found in blood plasma) to fibrin. Fibrin is an insoluble protein that forms fibres. The fibres form a mesh across the wound. Red blood cells and other cells get trapped in a tangle of fibrin threads, forming a blood clot. Blood clot formation is followed by scab formation.

### Defence against microorganisms that have entered the body
White blood cells defend the body against disease. There are two typed of white blood cells: Lymphocytes and Phagocytes. Lymphocytes produce antibodies while Phagocytes engulf and digest microorganisms.

1. Invading microorganisms have antigens on their surface that the human body can recognise as being foreign
2. When the body recognises a foreign antigenm lymphocytes produce antibodies that are complimentary in shape to the antigen. 
3. Antibodies immobilise microorganisms by clumping them together.
4. Immobilisation of the microorganisms stops it reproducing and prevents the spread of infection
5. The clump of microorganisms is then destroyed by phagocytosis

### Defence against microorganisms that have entered the body

#### Antibodies

Antigens are chemical markers on the surface of a microbe that alert the lymphocyte to produce matching complementary antibodies.

**Antigen = antibody-generating substances**

- The lymphocytes produce antibodies whose shapes are complimentary to the shape of the antigens on the microbe
- The antibodies immobilise the microbes, clumping them together. This also stops reproduction.

The immobilisation of these pathogens reduce the spread of disease and their symptoms.


#### Phagocytosis by Phagocytes

Special white blood cells called phagocytes destroy microorganisms by engulfing and digesting them. (enzymes inside the phagocytes digest the microorganisms and destroy them.) The process is called phagocytosis. Phagocytes can sqeeze out of blood capillaries and move around the body to the site of infection. If the skin is cut or grazed, for example, phagocytes will collect at the site of damage to destroy any microorganisms that might get in. Phagocytes can destroy microorganisms that are immobilised or clumped by antibodies.

Both lymphocytes and phagocytes can work together by first clumping the cells together and then digesting them.

## Immunity

### Primary and Secondary Responses

The primary immune response happens when someone encounters an antigen for they very first time. During a primary infection the level of antibodies slowly increases, peaks at a relative low level and then decreases relative quickly. The infected individual is usually ill. When an individual encounters an antigen, their body produces memory lymphocytes (memory cells). Memory lymphocytes remain in the body for many yearsd and assist with future immune responses if the same antigen is encountered again.

The secondary response happens when an individual responds to a previously encountered antigen. (It could be the individual's second or third or... etc. time encountering the particular antigen) The Immune system will already have produced memory lymphocytes and they will still be present in the body. The memory lymphocytes will be able to produce a high level of antibodies very quickly and the level will remain high for a long period of time. An individual is often unaware when the secondary response occurs because they may not symptoms i.e. they may not catch the disease/become ill.

Individuals who are protected against a particular infection or disease are described as being immune the the diseas. If a person is immune it means that their antibody levels are hight enough, or high enough levels can be produced quickly enough, to combat the microorganism if it enters the body again.

### Vaccinations

Vaccinations make individuals immuns to diseases. Vaccines contain antigens. The body's lymphocytes produce antibodies in response to the antigen present in the vaccine. Memory lymphocytes will also be produced. This is the primary response. If the microorganism with the same antigens is encountered again, after the vaccine, the memory lymphocytes will produce large numbers of the antibody very quickly. The individual will not get sick because the pathogen will be killed before it has the chance to breed and spread through the body. This is the secondary response. 

Sometimes a booster vaccination is needed to maintain the high levels of antibodies needed to provide immunity.

An individual with memory lymphocytes for a particular infection will be immune to it.

In 1976, a scientist Edward Jenner developed a vaccine that would prevent people from catching smallpox. Smallpox was a very deadly disease. It killed more children each year than any other disease and also killed many thousands of adults.

## Medicine

Medicines have been around for a very long time (although not the same type that we get from the pharmacist today.)

Medicines are subtances that help us recover from illnesses or reduce discomfort or pain.

## Antibiotics

Antibiotics are used to treat infection caused by bacteria. An antibiotic is a chemical that kills bacteria or reduces their growth.

## Investigating the effect of different chemicals on the growth of bacteria

Method:
1. Add some mint leaves and a small volume of thanol to a mortar and grind using pestle.
2. Soak a small disc of filter paper in the plant extract.
3. Repeat this process using a different plant, for example wild garlic leaves.
4. Using sterile forceps, place the two plant discs on opposite sides of a pre-prepared Petri dish containing nutrient agar with bacterial culture.
5. Tape the lid of the Petri dish closed.
6. Invert the Petri dish (to prevent condensation) and incubate for 48-72 hourse at 25 degrees centigrade.
7. Measure the diameter of any clear zones around the two discs to compare the antibacterial properties of the chemicals in two plant species.

The plant chemicals will diffues through the agar from each disc and if they are effective against the bacterium. they will stop its growth or kill it. A region of no bacterial growth, or a region where bacteria have been killed, will appear clear.

## Variables

Experiments involve things that can change, known as variables.

There are three kinds of variable:
- independent variable
- dependent variable
- control variable

The independent variable is the variable that is altered or changed during the experiment. It stands alone - it does not depend on any other variable in the investigation. On a graph, the independent variable is plotted on the horizontal x-axis.

The dependent variable is the variable that is measured during the experiment for each change in the indepent variable. It is the variable that changes because the independent variable was changed. On a graph of results, the dependent variable is plotted on the vertical y-axis.

The controlled variables are the variables that are deliberate kept the same. For a practical investigation to be fair test which produces valid results, just two variables should change - the independent variable and the dependent variable. Everything else should remain the same. In other words, every other variable should controlled.

In practice:
Independent - Plant extract (ginger; clove; cumin; cinnamon)
Dependent - Diameter of clear zone
Control - Temperature; Time; Volume of plant extract; type of seeded bacteria; incubation time; concentration of plant extract; incubation time; volume of agar.

## Antibiotic resistance in bacteria

When bacteria are treated with an antibiotic most of them are killed. However, a small number may survive because they have gene (caused by a mutation) that provides resistance. A mutation is a random spontaneous change in the structure of DNA.

As the resistant bacteria are the only ones that survive, they are the only ones that can breed and they pass on their resistance gene to the next generation. Soon the only bacteria remaining will be the mutated resistant forms.

## Non-communicable diseases

Non-communicable diseases are diseases that are not infectious (they cannot be passed from one person to the next). They can be a consequence of lifestyle, or due to an individual inheriting a gene (or a combination of genes) that predisposes them to developing some conditions.

1. Life style Factors linked to disease

Life style factores that are linked to disease include diet choices, exercise, sunexposure and drugs.

- Diet and disease

Eating too many foods high in fat and sugar has two main effects:

Obesity can occur - which can cause type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diesease (heart or blood vessel diseases, e.g. heart attack, stroke)

The individual will not be getting a balanced diet and probably not enough fruit and veg, meaning that they miss out on essential vitamins and minerals.

- Exercise and Health

Exercise is a means of using energy. If the energy we use in exercise is less than the amount we eat, then we run the risk of becoming overweight or obese. Exercide is also good for the body in many other ways. The right type of exercise can strengthen our bones. help our circulatory system and even help our mood.

- Overexposure to the sun

Too much UV radiation from the sun, or sunbeds, can cause skin cancer. The UV light can cause mutation in the skin that can lead to cancer (abnormal cell division). The possibility of getting skin cancer can be reduced by decreasing the time spent in the strong sun, covering up and using sun lotion.

- Misuse of drugs

Many people, including teens, drink too much alcohol and cause harm to themselves and others. Binge drinking is a particular problem. This occurs when a large amount of alcohol is drunk over a short period of time, for example, on one night out.

Alcohol can damage the liver and cause liver disease. Many other parts of the body can be damaged as well. Drinking during pregnancy can cause serious damage to the foetus, including brain damage.

Smoking can seriously damage health. The table below summarises some of the main harmful effects.

|Substance in smoke|Harmful effect|
|-|-|
|Tar|- Causes lung cancer: the lung cells divider in an abnormal way<br>- Causes bronchitis: the bronchi and bronchioles narrow and air flow to and from the alveoli is significantly reduced, potentionally leaving affected individuals struggling for oxygen.<br>- Causes emphysema: the alveoli are damaged and the surface area for gas exchange is therefore reduced|
|Nicotine|Addictive and increase both heart rate and blood pressure.|
|Carbon monoxide|Combines with red blood cells and reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. (Haemoglobin combines with carbon mono instead of oxygen.) This can result in a shortage of oxygen reaching the body tissues and therefore less oxygen is available for respiration.|

The introduction of smoking bans in many countries has proved very effective. it both encourages smokes to stop, and significantly reduces the chances of people being affected by passive smoking. (Passive smoking is when you breathe in someone else's tobacco smoke.)

The use of vapes (ecigs) is enabling many people to stop smoking tobacco. However, not everyone is in favour of vapes as many contain nicotine and they can encourage young people to take up smoking.

2. Inherited conditions

Some people carry a gene or a combination of genes that make them more likely than other people to get a certain disease. Individuals affected by type 1 diabetes and some cancer have genetic predisposition to the conditions. Other genetic conditions that are inherited include harmophilia, cystic fibrosis and Down's Syndrome.

# Unit 2 - Genetics

The passing on of family characteristics from parents to offspring is called inheritance. Genetics is the scientific study of inheritance.

## Genetic Information

The genome is the entire genetic material of an organism. Genetic material is stored in the nucleus. The nuvleus contains structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes are thin strands of DNA. Chromosomes are subdivided into smaller sections called genes. There aare hundreds of genes in each chromosome. A gene is a short length of DNA that codes for a particular characteristic.

Organisms' characteristics are passed on from the generation to generation by genes, for examples fur colours in mice and eye colour in humans. Genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis can also be passed on from parents to offspring by genes.

Normally, chromosomes occur in functional pairs. The chromosome in a paire are called homologous (same, position) chromosomes. One chromosome originates from the mother, and the other originates from the father.

The chromosomes in a homologous pair have the same genes in the same order, but there might be a variation in the forms of the genes. For example, both chromosomes in a homologous pair could have the gener for eye colours, but on one chromosome the gene could code for blue, while on the other it could code for brown. Different forms of the same gene are called alleles. Genes work in pairs.
