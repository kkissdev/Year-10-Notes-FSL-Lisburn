## Disease

Health is defined as being free from communicable and non-communicable disease.
- **Communicable Disease** - a disease that can be passed from one living organism to another (an **infectious** disease) (like malaria)
- **Non-Communicable Disease** - a disease that is not passed from one living organism to another (like cancer)

### Communicable Diseases

Most communicable diseases are caused by microorganisms (microbes).  
An organism that can cause disease is called a pathogen.  
There are three main types of **disease-causing (pathogenic) microorganism**:
- Bacteria
- Viruses
- Fungi

#### 1. Bacteria

Bacteria are single celled organisms.

It is similar to animal and plant cells with its cytoplasm and cell membrane. However, it is different from them because it has plasmids while they don't, bacteria have non-cellulose cell walls, while animal cells dont and plant cells have cellulose walls, and bacteria have no nucleus unlike plants and animals.

Bacterial pathogens cause communicable diseases like salmonella and tuberculosis.

##### Salmonella

Salmonella food poisoning is an illness that can occur if living Salmonella bacteria enter the body. It can be found in raw meats, poultry and eggs. You can get it by eating contaminated foods. It can be prevented by avoiding not throughly cooked foods, or cross-contaminated foods.

It can be treated with antibiotics (which only kill bacteria)

##### Tuberculosis

It is airborne and spread through inhaling drops of saliva from coughs or sneezes of an infected person (droplet infection).

It can be treated with antibiotics (which only kill bacteria)
