## Non-communicable diseases

Non-communicable diseases are diseases that are not infectious (they cannot be passed from one person to the next). They can be a consequence of lifestyle, or due to an individual inheriting a gene (or a combination of genes) that predisposes them to developing some conditions.

1. Life style Factors linked to disease

Life style factores that are linked to disease include diet choices, exercise, sunexposure and drugs.

- Diet and disease

Eating too many foods high in fat and sugar has two main effects:

Obesity can occur - which can cause type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diesease (heart or blood vessel diseases, e.g. heart attack, stroke)

The individual will not be getting a balanced diet and probably not enough fruit and veg, meaning that they miss out on essential vitamins and minerals.

- Exercise and Health

Exercise is a means of using energy. If the energy we use in exercise is less than the amount we eat, then we run the risk of becoming overweight or obese. Exercide is also good for the body in many other ways. The right type of exercise can strengthen our bones. help our circulatory system and even help our mood.

- Overexposure to the sun

Too much UV radiation from the sun, or sunbeds, can cause skin cancer. The UV light can cause mutation in the skin that can lead to cancer (abnormal cell division). The possibility of getting skin cancer can be reduced by decreasing the time spent in the strong sun, covering up and using sun lotion.

- Misuse of drugs

Many people, including teens, drink too much alcohol and cause harm to themselves and others. Binge drinking is a particular problem. This occurs when a large amount of alcohol is drunk over a short period of time, for example, on one night out.

Alcohol can damage the liver and cause liver disease. Many other parts of the body can be damaged as well. Drinking during pregnancy can cause serious damage to the foetus, including brain damage.

Smoking can seriously damage health. The table below summarises some of the main harmful effects.

|Substance in smoke|Harmful effect|
|-|-|
|Tar|- Causes lung cancer: the lung cells divider in an abnormal way<br>- Causes bronchitis: the bronchi and bronchioles narrow and air flow to and from the alveoli is significantly reduced, potentionally leaving affected individuals struggling for oxygen.<br>- Causes emphysema: the alveoli are damaged and the surface area for gas exchange is therefore reduced|
|Nicotine|Addictive and increase both heart rate and blood pressure.|
|Carbon monoxide|Combines with red blood cells and reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. (Haemoglobin combines with carbon mono instead of oxygen.) This can result in a shortage of oxygen reaching the body tissues and therefore less oxygen is available for respiration.|

The introduction of smoking bans in many countries has proved very effective. it both encourages smokes to stop, and significantly reduces the chances of people being affected by passive smoking. (Passive smoking is when you breathe in someone else's tobacco smoke.)

The use of vapes (ecigs) is enabling many people to stop smoking tobacco. However, not everyone is in favour of vapes as many contain nicotine and they can encourage young people to take up smoking.

2. Inherited conditions

Some people carry a gene or a combination of genes that make them more likely than other people to get a certain disease. Individuals affected by type 1 diabetes and some cancer have genetic predisposition to the conditions. Other genetic conditions that are inherited include harmophilia, cystic fibrosis and Down's Syndrome.
