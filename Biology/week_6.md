## Medicine

Medicines have been around for a very long time (although not the same type that we get from the pharmacist today.)

Medicines are subtances that help us recover from illnesses or reduce discomfort or pain.

## Antibiotics

Antibiotics are used to treat infection caused by bacteria. An antibiotic is a chemical that kills bacteria or reduces their growth.

## Investigating the effect of different chemicals on the growth of bacteria

Method:
1. Add some mint leaves and a small volume of thanol to a mortar and grind using pestle.
2. Soak a small disc of filter paper in the plant extract.
3. Repeat this process using a different plant, for example wild garlic leaves.
4. Using sterile forceps, place the two plant discs on opposite sides of a pre-prepared Petri dish containing nutrient agar with bacterial culture.
5. Tape the lid of the Petri dish closed.
6. Invert the Petri dish (to prevent condensation) and incubate for 48-72 hourse at 25 degrees centigrade.
7. Measure the diameter of any clear zones around the two discs to compare the antibacterial properties of the chemicals in two plant species.

The plant chemicals will diffues through the agar from each disc and if they are effective against the bacterium. they will stop its growth or kill it. A region of no bacterial growth, or a region where bacteria have been killed, will appear clear.

## Variables

Experiments involve things that can change, known as variables.

There are three kinds of variable:
- independent variable
- dependent variable
- control variable

The independent variable is the variable that is altered or changed during the experiment. It stands alone - it does not depend on any other variable in the investigation. On a graph, the independent variable is plotted on the horizontal x-axis.

The dependent variable is the variable that is measured during the experiment for each change in the indepent variable. It is the variable that changes because the independent variable was changed. On a graph of results, the dependent variable is plotted on the vertical y-axis.

The controlled variables are the variables that are deliberate kept the same. For a practical investigation to be fair test which produces valid results, just two variables should change - the independent variable and the dependent variable. Everything else should remain the same. In other words, every other variable should controlled.

In practice:
Independent - Plant extract (ginger; clove; cumin; cinnamon)
Dependent - Diameter of clear zone
Control - Temperature; Time; Volume of plant extract; type of seeded bacteria; incubation time; concentration of plant extract; incubation time; volume of agar.

## Antibiotic resistance in bacteria

When bacteria are treated with an antibiotic most of them are killed. However, a small number may survive because they have gene (caused by a mutation) that provides resistance. A mutation is a random spontaneous change in the structure of DNA.

As the resistant bacteria are the only ones that survive, they are the only ones that can breed and they pass on their resistance gene to the next generation. Soon the only bacteria remaining will be the mutated resistant forms.
