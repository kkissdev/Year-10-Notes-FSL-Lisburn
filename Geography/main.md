# Unit 1: Geology

The whole Earth is made up of rock. The study of rocks is known as **geology**. People who study rocks are called **geologists**. **Geology** is studied in Geography because of rock's important role in our everyday lives.

## Minerals

A mineral is a solid which is made up of atoms as a crystal. It must be naturally occuring and inorganic.

The two most common **rock building materials** are feldspars and quartz. Minerals usually exist in rocks as structures known as the Earth's crust.

### Mineral Compositions

**Granite** - It contains quartz, feldspars (potassium for its orange colour) and micas (particularly black biotite).

**Sandstone** - Quartz with feldspars (silicone and oxygen)

**Limestone** - Calcite / Calcium Carbonate, quartz

## Rare Earth Minerals (REM)

Some minerals differ drastically in frequency. REM are a group of seventeen chemical elements that occur together in the periodic table. All are metals and have similar properties which often causes them to be found together in ore deposits.

## The three rock groups
All rocks can be classed into one of three groups:
-  Sedimentary
-  Igneous
-  Metamorphic

### Sedimentary rocks
These form when particles of minerals which were eroded from rock in one place get stuck together again another place, to form new rock.

These can be formed from 2 types of sediment:
- Broken pieces of rock like sand or gravel e.g. sandstone or mudstone
- Remains of plants or animals e.g. coal or limestone

## Recognising sedimentary rocks

- Easily identified layers made up of lots of little pieces seemingly glued together
- The presence of fossils
- Layers are varied in texture and colour
- Some will react with acid (limestone)

### Shale 

- Very fine-grained sedimentary rock
- Usually breaks into small, flat pieces
- Can be turned into [oil/gas]

### Sandstone

- Weak rock
- Contains sand-size minerals or tiny rock grains
- Cannot be used for many things

### Limestone

- Composed of skeletal fragments (mostly) of underwater animals like coral

### Flint

- Second most common rock
- Made of once living organisms
