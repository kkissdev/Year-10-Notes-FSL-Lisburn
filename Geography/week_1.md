# Unit 1: Geology

The whole Earth is made up of rock. The study of rocks is known as **geology**. People who study rocks are called **geologists**. **Geology** is studied in Geography because of rock's important role in our everyday lives.

## Minerals

A mineral is a solid which is made up of atoms as a crystal. It must be naturally occuring and inorganic.

The two most common **rock building materials** are feldspars and quartz. Minerals usually exist in rocks as structures known as the Earth's crust.

### Mineral Compositions

**Granite** - It contains quartz, feldspars (potassium for its orange colour) and micas (particularly black biotite).

**Sandstone** - Quartz with feldspars (silicone and oxygen)

**Limestone** - Calcite / Calcium Carbonate, quartz

## Rare Earth Minerals (REM)

Some minerals differ drastically in frequency. REM are a group of seventeen chemical elements that occur together in the periodic table. All are metals and have similar properties which often causes them to be found together in ore deposits.
