# Geology

## The three rock groups
All rocks can be classed into one of three groups:
-  Sedimentary
-  Igneous
-  Metamorphic

### Sedimentary rocks
These form when particles of minerals which were eroded from rock in one place get stuck together again another place, to form new rock.

These can be formed from 2 types of sediment:
- Broken pieces of rock like sand or gravel e.g. sandstone or mudstone
- Remains of plants or animals e.g. coal or limestone
