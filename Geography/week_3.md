# Geology

## Recognising sedimentary rocks

- Easily identified layers made up of lots of little pieces seemingly glued together
- The presence of fossils
- Layers are varied in texture and colour
- Some will react with acid (limestone)

### Shale 

- Very fine-grained sedimentary rock
- Usually breaks into small, flat pieces
- Can be turned into [oil/gas]

### Sandstone

- Weak rock
- Contains sand-size minerals or tiny rock grains
- Cannot be used for many things

### Limestone

- Composed of skeletal fragments (mostly) of underwater animals like coral

### Flint

- Second most common rock
- Made of once living organisms
