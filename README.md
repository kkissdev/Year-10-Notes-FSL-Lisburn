# Year-10-Notes-FSL-Lisburn

These contain the notes for Year 10 of Friends' School Lisburn from the dates of August 28 2025 to June 2026

## Markdown

Sometimes you may see [placeholder / insert funny thing / school amirite]. These simply represent that the "options" ("placeholder", "insert funny thing" and "school amirite" are all "options), which are separated by forward slashes, can be interchangable or can all be accurate. You may have to use context clues to figure out whether it applies to all or just one. There can be any number of "options".

## Noting System

This noting system will be different from the Year 9 repository. The subject's notes will be separated by weeks. If a week has little content, multiple weeks can be put into one file.

To see the date of which you want to copy up on, check "weeks.md" and find the date. The header (e.g. "Week 1 - 28 Aug") will be the week you need to check. Dates correlated to the week are usually the week beginning (the first day of school on that week, not Monday). In each week header, you should find info on what subjects are copied up to the end of that week (**fin** - finished, **hlt** - finished all content given, more content to come, **emp** - not finished with content given)

### Directory Example

Geography  
|  
|- week_1.md  
|- week_2-3.md  
|- week_4-5-6.md  
|- week_7.md  

### --- END --- 

It's also worth mentioning each subject gets a ```main.md``` which established units and subheadings categorised on the file. This makes it easier as it is now sorted by date or content.
